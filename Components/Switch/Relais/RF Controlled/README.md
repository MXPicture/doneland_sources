# RF-Controlled Relais

> Using RF-Remote Controls To Turn Devices On And Off


Most people use this type of *remote control* every day without knowing: the vast majority of *garage door openers* uses this technology.



## Overview

With *RF controlled* relais, the control information is transmitted *over the air* using *radio waves* in *unlicensed bands* (*315MHz* in the US, *433MHz* in Europe).

Ready-to-use *RF relais* are available for less than *EUR 3.00* per piece:

> [!CAUTION]
> Look carefully at the device description. Devices can be controllable via *RF* (make sure you use the correct frequency: *315MHz* in the US, *433MHz* in Europe), via *Wifi/2.4GHz*, or *both*. The picture shows (from *left* to *right*) a *WiFi-only*, a *WiFi/RF*, and a *RF-only 433MHz* device. 



### Advantages

Since *sender* (*remote control*) and *receiver* (i.e. *garage door opener*) communicate *directly*, the setup is *simple* and no special prerequisite is required, nor are there points of failure beyond your control:

When your *WiFi* network fails or your *phone company's network* is temporarily down, your *RF-Controlled Solutions* continue to work.

### Disadvantages

For the same reasons, *RF-Controlled Solutions* are somewhat inflexible: 


* **No App Control:** you need to be in close vicinity and send out the required *radio signals* to the device you want to control. You cannot control the device from other places simply by grabbing your *smartphone* and using an *app*.
* **Physical Cloning:** if you need more than one *remote control*, you cannot simply take another *smartphone*, add an *app* and punch in your *password*. Much similar to *making a duplicate physical key*, you would need to get *another remote control* and *clone its signal*.

They can also be more *insecure*:

Basic *RF-Control Solutions* always send out the same *control code* over the air. Anyone in close vicinity could *pick it up* and *play it back later*, effectively gaining control.

More secure *RF-Control Solutions* use *rolling codes* that are *not* always the same. They cannot easily be picked up and replayed.


## Usage

With *ready-to-use* devices, there are just two steps required:

* **Electrical Connections:** most devices come with *six* screw terminals. Connect *Lin* and *Nin* to *AC power*, *Lout* and *Nout* to the *AC load* you want to remotely control, and (optionally) *S1* and *S2* to a mechanical switch for manual switching. If you purchased a complete *plug*, then you simply plug it into any outlet, then plug the load into the *remote control plug*.
* **Pairing:** to *pair* the device with a *RF remote control*, follow the vendor instructions. Typically, the device has a *button* that needs to be either pressed *two* or *three* times until an *LED* turns on, or needs to be kept pressed for *3-4 seconds*.

### Pairing Tips

Occasionally, the *pairing instructions* by the vendor are wrong. Firmware and device versions change frequently and can become outdated quickly. 

Here are a few tips:

* **Connect Power First:** Pairing requires the electronics inside the device to be powered on. The device needs to be connected to *AC* power before you can start pairing it.
* **Clear Device:** In a first step, try *clearing* the device by pressing its button *eight* times. A flashing LED indicates success.
+ **Pair Remote Control:** Next, try pressing the button *twice* and check whether the *LED* lights up. If it does not light up, try holding the button for at least *3 seconds*. When the *LED* lights up constantly, then the device is in *pairing mode*.
* **Pair Remote Control Button:** Finally, while the device is in *pairing mode*, press the button on the remote control that you want to use to switch the relais. A flashing *LED* indicates successful pairing.
