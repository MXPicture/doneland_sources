# Network

> Anything That Connects Microcontrollers With IP Networks 

The *ESP* family of *microcontrollers* comes with *WiFi* (and in some models *Bluetooth*) support built-in. If network connectivity is an issue in your project, rather than adding *WiFi* shields to an *Arduino*, better use a *ESP8266* or *ESP32* right away.

If a *wired* network connectivity is needed, you can't avoid adding additional hardware.

## Ethernet

*Wired* (*Ethernet*) network connection may be necessary if you want to permanently connect a microcontroller in the most robust way.

There are a number of cheap and easy-to-implement *Ethernet* boards available:

* [ENC28J60](ENC28J60): *Ethernet* breakout board based on the *ENC28J60* controller using a **SPI** interface and running on **3.3V**
