> Awesome Little Wolf In Sheep's Clothing: Looks Like A NE555 Timer But Is A Full-Fledged Microcontroller

Some tasks are too complex to be implemented solely with *discrete components* but not really *computing-intensive*: an *emergency light* needs to flash a **LED** with a given light pattern, or *sensor data* needs to be read and written to SD Card, or based on some *input*, different *outputs* need to be controlled - you get the idea.

The *ATTiny* family of microcontrollers is perfect for this. They are small (come in standard DIP housings), provide GPIOs and can do most of what their bigger brothers can do to - just not so fast, and with (much) less available memory.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ATTiny* are *so tiny* they don't come with *USB-to-Serial* functionality or any other means of connecting them to a *PC*. In order to upload *firmware*, you need to plug them into a *programmer*. That's a board with the missing USB functionality.
