# Raspberry Pi Foundation

> English Charity & Company Promoting The Study Of Computer Science 

When the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_Foundation) was founded in *2009*, its goal was the educational *study of computer science*. [Raspberry Pi Ltd](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) is a *commercial subsidiary* that develops [Raspberry Pi computers, microcontrollers and related hardware](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/). All revenues go back to the charity and educational projects of the *foundation*.

The foundation is supported by the *University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory* and *Broadcom*. Its aim is to *"promote the study of computer science and related topics, especially at the school level, and to put the fun back into learning computing."*

## Raspberry Pi
Most IT and DIY people tie the term *Raspberry* to one of its *single-board computers: the *Raspberry Pi* that surfaced in *2012* and was developed by the *Raspberry Pi Foundation* in association with [Broadcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcom).

The initial version targeted *educational* and *school* purposes but quickly became successful outside *schools* for *robotics*, *automation*, and *hobbyists*, because of low cost, modularity, open design, and adoption of *HDMI* and *USB* standards.

In a nutshell, *Raspberry Pi* minicomputers were full-fledged computers with an operating system, yet low in price and hugely extensible. 

### Raspberry Pi 5
Currently, [Raspberry Pi 5](materials/raspberry_pi_5_brief.pdf) is the most up-to-date version. With its *64-bit quad-core Arm Cortex-A76 processor running at 2.4GHz*, a *800MHz VideoCore VII GPU* with *dual 4Kp60 display output over HDMI* and *camera support* from its own *Image Signal Processor* and up to *8GB RAM*, it is currently *the fastest* Raspberry device, making it up to *3x* faster than its predecessor, the *Raspberry Pi 4*.

A complete set including housing and SSD drive can be assembled for under EUR 150. The *Raspberry Pi 5* board alone sells for around EUR 80.00 (with *8GB RAM*).

> [!TIP]
> *Raspberry Pi* typically runs on a *Debian*-based *Linux* distribution which makes it an ideal host for *Python*-based *automation servers* such as *HomeAssistant*.

However, *Raspberry* produces much more *hardware* than the *Raspberry Pi* including its own *microcontrollers* and *boards*.

## RP2040/Raspberry Pi Pico
The [RP2040](materials/rp2040_datasheet.pdf) is the first *microcontroller* (*32-bit dual ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller*) designed by *Raspberry Pi Ltd.* and is used on their *Raspberry Pi Pico* board. 

This board is very *small* (51x21mm), *cheap*, and *very powerful* with a good instruction set: when introduced in 2021, the *microcontroller* itself costed USD 1.00 and the full *Pico* board USD 4.00. Today, boards using the *RP2040* are produced by various manufacturers, and generic boards are available for less than EUR 1.80.

The microcontroller can be programmed in assembly, C, C++, Free Pascal, Rust, Go, MicroPython, CircuitPython, Ada and TypeScript and is powerful enough to run *TensorFlow Lite*.

## Other
*Raspberry* produces a [range of hardware](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/) that is less relevant to *makers*:

* **Raspberry Pi 400 PC Kit:** A keyboard with a built-in *Raspberry Pi 4*, providing low-priced and rugged computing experience for *schools*
* [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](materials/raspberry_pi_zero_2_w_brief.pdf): A powerful *single-board computer* for under USD 15.00. It is a *drop-in replacement* for previous versions of *Raspberry Pi Zero* boards, just up to *5x* faster than the original *Raspberry Pi Zero*. It runs on the *RP3A0*, a custom-built system-in-package designed by *Raspberry Pi* that uses a *quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53* processor clocked at 1GHz and 512MB of SDRAM.
