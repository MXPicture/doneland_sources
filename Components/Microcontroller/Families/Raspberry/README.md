> Charity & Company For The Study Of Computer Science 

Often the term *Raspberry* is used synonymously with the *Raspberry Pi* minicomputer that surfaced 2012.

## Raspberry Pi

This computer was developed by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_Foundation) primarily for *education* but was soon adopted by *Makers* around the globe for all kinds of use cases: it is a modular, well-engineered, small and cheap *single-board computer* running a *Debian*-based *Linux* distribution.

This makes a *Raspberry Pi* a perfect choice to use it as *host* for *Python*-based software, such as *HomeAssistant*.

> [!TIP]
> The open-source software *HomeAssistant* on a *Raspberry Pi* can run day & night and provide the home base for all of your *devices*, *sensors*, and *microcontroller projects*. It provides a single point of management with its *dashboard* and many integration standards, i.e. for *ESPxxxx microcontroller devices* based on *ESPHome*.

### Raspberry Pi 5
Currently, [Raspberry Pi 5](materials/raspberry_pi_5_brief.pdf) is the most up-to-date version. With its *64-bit quad-core Arm Cortex-A76 processor running at 2.4GHz*, a *800MHz VideoCore VII GPU* with *dual 4Kp60 display output over HDMI* and *camera support* from its own *Image Signal Processor* and up to *8GB RAM*, it is currently *the fastest* Raspberry device, making it up to *3x* faster than its predecessor, the *Raspberry Pi 4*.

A complete set including housing and SSD drive can be assembled for under EUR 150. The *Raspberry Pi 5* board alone sells for around EUR 80.00 (with *8GB RAM*).


## Raspberry Pi Foundation
*Raspberry Pi Foundation* is the *charity* behind the *Raspberry Pi* and many other *products* produced by[Raspberry Pi Ltd](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) in association with [Broadcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcom). 

*Raspberry Pi Ltd* is a *commercial subsidiary* that develops the [Raspberry Pi computers, microcontrollers and related hardware](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/). All revenues go back to the charity and educational projects of the *foundation*.

The foundation is supported by the *University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory* and *Broadcom*. Its aim is to *"promote the study of computer science and related topics, especially at the school level, and to put the fun back into learning computing."*

## Other Hardware

*Raspberry* is aiming to provide [top-notch hardware](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/) at lowest prices targeting *educational scenarios* like *schools*. Of course, *hobbyists* and even *industrial customers* use their product lines for the same reasons: dependable high quality hardware at reasonable prices.

Meanwhile *Raspberry* is producing its own *microcontrollers* and *system-in-packages*.

### RP2040
The [RP2040](materials/rp2040_datasheet.pdf) is the first *microcontroller* (*32-bit dual ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller*) designed by *Raspberry Pi Ltd.*.

The microcontroller can be programmed in assembly, C, C++, Free Pascal, Rust, Go, MicroPython, CircuitPython, Ada and TypeScript.

### Raspberry Pi Pico
The *RP2040* is used on the *Raspberry Pi Pico* board which is *small* (51x21mm), *cheap*, and yet powerful enough to run i.e. *TensorFlow Lite*.

When introduced in 2021, the *microcontroller* itself costed USD 1.00 and the full *Pico* board ran at USD 4.00. Today, boards using the *RP2040* are produced by a wide range of manufacturers and vendors, and generic boards are available for less than EUR 1.80.

### Raspberry Pi 400

A keyboard with a built-in *Raspberry Pi 4*, providing low-priced and rugged computing experience for *schools*.

### Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
The [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](materials/raspberry_pi_zero_2_w_brief.pdf) is a powerful *single-board computer* for under USD 15.00. It is a *drop-in replacement* for previous versions of *Raspberry Pi Zero* boards, just up to *5x* faster than the original *Raspberry Pi Zero*. 

It runs on the *RP3A0*, a custom-built system-in-package designed by *Raspberry Pi* that uses a *quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53* processor clocked at 1GHz and 512MB of SDRAM.
