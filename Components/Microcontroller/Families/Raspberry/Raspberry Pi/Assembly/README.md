# Raspberry Pi 5 Assembly

> Assembling A Raspberry Pi 5 And Installing HomeAssistant

*Raspberry Pi 5* typically does not come *pre-assembled*. Instead, you purchase the plain motherboard (available with *4GB* and *8GB RAM*), and the required additional components.

While there are some vendors offering *pre-assembled Raspberry Pi 5* devices, it's not worth the money. Assembling it takes just a screwdriver, 10 minutes of time, and almost no skills. 

Added benefit: by assembling it yourself, you get a much better understanding of its design, and you can *vary* and *tailor* its components to your needs - i.e. the type and size of mass storage.

## Assembly Steps
I walk you through the entire process of assembly:

* **Parts Required:** learn what the components are that you need, and what your options are to *tailor* the *Raspberry Pi* to your needs.
* **Assembling the Raspberry:** step-by-step tour explaining all steps it takes to put the parts together
* *Installing HomeAssistant:* one popular use case is running *Home Assistant* on the *Raspberry Pi*, so I'll show you the few steps it takes to install it on your *Raspberry Pi 5*.
* *Tips & Tricks:* learn a few clever tricks. i.e. how to easily show the *Raspberry Pi Screen* as a "Picture-in-Picture" *window* on your regular computer screen.
