# Raspberry Pi

> Powerful Single-Board Computer Running Debian

*Raspberry Pi* is a full-fledged mini computer. By default, it runs a *Debian*-based *Linux* distribution. Often, it is used to host the *Python*-based software *Homeassistant*.

> [!TIP]
> If you are looking for *practical advice* on how to assemble, set up, and run a *Raspberry Pi* as *Homeassistant* server, you may want to directly go to [Raspberry Pi as HomeAssistant Server]().





## Generations

*Raspberry Pi* was released *2012* and targeted primarily towards *educational use*. It soon was adopted by the community for *robotics*, *automation*, and many other use cases requiring a backend *server* with sufficient performance.

| Version  | Processor | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 700MHz 32-bit Single-Core ARM11 | **Raspberry Pi Model B** in 2012: The simpler and cheaper **Raspberry Pi Model A** followed later the same year. An improved **Raspberry Pi Model B+** was released in 2014.  |
| 2 | 900MHz 32-bit Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 |  **Raspberry Pi 2 B** in 2015: featured a 900MHz 32-bit processor and came with *1GB* RAM. **Revision 1.2** switched to a *64-bit A53* processor that would continued to be used in version *3*. It was clocked at *900MHz*. |
| 3 | 1.2GHz 64-bit Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 | **Raspberry Pi 3 Model B** in 2016: changed clock speed from *900MHz* to *1.2GHz*, added *802.11ac WiFi* and *USB-Boot* capabilities. In *2018*, **Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+** surfaced: clock speed was raised to *1.4GHz*, *Ethernet* speed was tripled to *300Mbit/s*, dual-band 100 Mbit/s *WiFi* was added. This was followed by **Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+** with similar enhancements. |
| 4 | 1.5GHz 64-bit ARM Cortex-A72 | **Raspberry Pi 4 Model A/B** in 2019: it added *Bluetooth 5.0*, throughput-unlimited full *Gigabit Ethernet*, two *USB 2.0 ports*, two *USB 3.0 ports*, from *1 to 8 GB RAM*, *dual-monitor support* via *Micro HDMI (Type D)* ports with *4K Resolution*, plus *USB-C power supply*. **Raspberry Pi 400** was added in 2020 as a *keyboard computer*: a *Raspberry Pi 4* with *4GB RAM* and a *1.8 GHz clock* was integrated into a *keyboard housing*. |
| 5 | 2.4GHz 64-bit ARM Cortex-A76 | [Raspberry Pi 5](materials/raspberry_pi_5_brief.pdf) in 2023: *4* or *8GB RAM*, *VideoCore VII GPU*, supporting *Vulkan 1.1*, for better performance (graphics-intensive tasks, 4K video playback), four *USB 3.0 ports*, *Bluetooth 5.2*, *802.11ax WiFi 6*, faster *MicroSD card slot*, better *USB boot capabilities*, can be powered via *USB C*, *Power over Ethernet* (*PoE*), improved power efficiency, *real-time clock* (*RTC*) |

> [!TIP]
> If you own an older model, there is typically no need to immediately upgrade. Given the significant performance boost found in *Raspberry Pi 5* and marginal *price differences*, I would not recommend to buy an older model. *Raspberry Pi 5* is *future proof* with guaranteed support until *2036*.











### Assembly Required
Typically, *Raspberry Pi* is sold either as *bare board* or as *starter kits* (containing all required parts such as *housing*, *fan*, etc.).

While there are vendors offering *pre-assembled devices* that are *ready to run*, this is a niche market.

Assembling a *Raspberry Pi* is part of the intended *educational aspect* and does not require much special knowledge. A typical assembly takes a *screwdriver* and *10 minutes of time*.
