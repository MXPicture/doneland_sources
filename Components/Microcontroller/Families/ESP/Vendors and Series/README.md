> An Introduction to ESP32 Development Board Designers and Their Product Lineups

When searching for *ESP32 development boards*, the sheer variety can be overwhelming. To help simplify the process, this section aims to organize well-known development board designers and their product series. I will also compare these to *generic, no-name boards* to help you identify which board best suits your needs and offers the best value for money.

Please note, this is a work in progress. Since I am working on this in my spare time, I’m covering boards in the order that I personally experiment with them. Therefore, don’t expect this section to be fully complete just yet.
