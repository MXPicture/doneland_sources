# Programming T-Display

> Creating And Uploading Custom Firmware To LilyGo T-Display Development Boards

The [T-Display](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/lilygo%C2%AE-ttgo-t-display-1-14-inch-lcd-esp32-control-board) can be programmed in a variety of ways:

* **Upload Premade Firmware:** upload *firmware* that was made by someone else, i.e. [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/basics/install-binary/) for controlling *RGB LED strips*.
* **Program Firmware Yourself:** use one of the development environments such as *ArduinoIDE* or *platformio* to write the firmware yourself. This obviously requires some programming skills.
* **ESPHome:** use *ESPHome* to automatically program firmware to your needs. This requires setting up *ESPHome* (and also *Home Assistant* if you want to leverage all functionality).
