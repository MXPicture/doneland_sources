# Lilygo T-Display

> ESP32 Development Boards With Integrated Display And Battery Charger


The Chinese company [Lilygo](https://www.lilygo.cc/) produces a variety of *IoT* devices. Its *T-Display* series specializes on *ESP32*-based [development boards with integrated displays](https://www.lilygo.cc/collections/basic-module) that all come with integrated *LiIon battery* connector and charger. *T-Display boards* are a *one-stop* solution for many microcontroller-based *IoT projects*.

The boards base on *ESP* microcontrollers, i.e. *ESP32S*, *ESP32-S3*, and *ESP32-C3/6*. [T-Pico](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-pico) *adds* an additional *Raspberry RP2040* to the *ESP* microcontroller (so you can use *both*).





## Overview

Since *Lilygo* has been around for years and has a reputation to defend, the board designs and build quality are excellent. Often more importantly, there is [detailed documentation on github](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO) as well as helpful after-sales *customer support*. 

> [!TIP]
> *T-Display* boards are only slightly more expensive than generic boards (especially when you take into account the added hardware like display and battery charger, and even more so when you take advantage of *special sales* that regularly occur on marketplaces like *AliExpress*). 


### Integrated Display
The primary feature of *T-Display development boards* is their integrated display that comes in almost all shapes and technologies. 

All boards also come with a connector for a *LiIon* battery: the board can be powered via USB (stationary or off a power bank), or via a dedicated *LiIon battery*. This battery gets automatically recharged once the board is connected to USB power.

Some models also feature programmable buttons and shells.

## Models

*T-Display models* vary in features, so always check their specs before you buy, or use the table below for quick comparison. It lists the most commonly used *general purpose* models, their microcontroller, and display type and size. For more details, click the model name.
