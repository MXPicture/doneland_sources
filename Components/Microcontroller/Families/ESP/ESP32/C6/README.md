# C6

> Premier IoT Microcontroller With WiFi 6, ZigBee And Threads


The **C6** was announced in *2021*. It took until *2023* before boards were available in quantities and is a *connectivity* update to the **C3** with added support for *Wifi 6*, *Zigbee* and *Thread*.

## Compared To ESP32 C3

Here is the list of enhancements compared to the **C3**:

| Feature | Addition |
| --- | --- |
| GPIO | 30 instead of 22 |
| I2C | 2 instead of 1 |
| Bluetooth | BLE v5.0 instead of BLE v4.2 |
| WiFi | WiFi6 added |
| SRAM | 512 instead of 400 |
| ROM | 384 instead of 320 |
| RTC RAM | 16 instead of 8 |
| ADC | 7 instead of 6 channels |
| UART | 3 instead of 2 |
| SD Slave | added  |
| TWAI (CAN 2.0) | 2 instead of 1 |
| Zigbee/Thread | added |

The number of **SPI** was reduced from 3 to 1.

> [!CAUTION]
> As of this writing, the **C6** does not support the *Arduino Framework* yet. You cannot currently program it using the *Arduino IDE* or *platformio*. Instead, you must use the *ESP-IDF* from *Expressif*. This is going to change soonish, and eventually, the **C6**, too, will support the universal *ArduinoIDE*.
