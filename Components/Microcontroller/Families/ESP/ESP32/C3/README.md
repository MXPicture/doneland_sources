# C3

> The First ESP Microcontroller Based on RISC-V Architecture And A Very Fast One-Core CPU


In 2020, *Expressif* released both the *S-Series* and the first member of the *C-Series*.

## C3 - RISC-V Architecture

The **ESP32 C3** marks a fundamental change in processor architecture as it now uses *RISC-V*. The **C3** is a *very fast* one-core microcontroller.
