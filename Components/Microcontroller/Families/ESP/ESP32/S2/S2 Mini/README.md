# S2 Mini

> Powerful ESP32 S2 Board That Works With ESP8266 Shields


The pink [S2 Mini microcontroller board](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/s2/s2_mini.html) (aka *LOLIN S2 Mini* or *Wemos S2 Mini*) uses the *much more powerful **single-core** ESP32 S2 microcontroller* while preserving pin compatibility to the *ESP8266 D1 Mini*. Like the *ESP8266*, the *ESP32-S2* does not support *bluetooth*. 

Its additional capabilities (including generous *26 GPIOs*) are exposed via two additional pin header rows.



<img src="images/s2_mini_top_overview_t.png" width="40%" height="40%" />


Its form factor enables the *S2 Mini* to continue to use *shields* that were originally designed for the *D1 Mini*, i.e. *battery shields*.

> [!TIP]
> The *ESP32-S2 Mini* uses an unusual design for communicating via *USB cable*: it exposes *different ports* in *normal mode* vs. *firmware upload mode*, and because of this, many tools like [ESPHome Web Tool](https://web.esphome.io/) are **incompatible** with this board (as of this writing). *Classic IDEs* work flawlessly. If you are using [ESPHome](https://done.land/tools/software/esphome) and experience trouble flashing this board, there are great and simple-to-use [workarounds](https://done.land/tools/software/esphome/introduction/manualprovisioning). Generally, try and enable *OTA* (wireless *over-the-air* updates) so you can bypass its strange *USB communication interface* (the only flaw this excellent board seems to have).




> [!NOTE]
> While the *S2 Mini* microcontroller board is exceptional *value for the money*, the *S2* does not seem to be as *mainstream* as other microcontrollers with incomplete documentation and support: i.e. the *pins_arduino.h* file shipped with the *Espressif ESP32 Kit* needs manual tweaking to be able to use common pin labels like *D0* or *D1* in your code. For experienced users, the *ESP32-S2 Mini* is *excellent bang for the buck* (this board is regularly available for under â‚¬2). As a rookie, you might want to avoid the *ESP32 S2* and stick to trusted *ESP8266* or *ESP32*.

## Hardware I2C Interface
Any pin can *emulate* a *I2C* interface (or define additional ones). Only the *hardware I2C interface* uses optimized hardware that does not put load on the microcontroller and is faster. Here are the pins:

| Pin | Label | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 33 | SCA | Data |
| 35 | SDL | Clock |

## Hardware SPI Interface
Any pin can *emulate* a *SPI* interface (or define additional ones). Only the *hardware SPI interface* uses optimized hardware that does not put load on the microcontroller and is faster. 

*SPI* is typically used by devices with a lot of data transfer, i.e. *Storage devices* or *color displays*. Using a *software SPI* will *significantly reduce* the performance of such devices or not work at all. Always use *hardware SPI*!

Here are the pins for hardware SPI:

| Pin | Label | Alternate Labels | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11 | MOSI | SDO, SDA | Master Out SLave In |
| 9 | MISO | SDI | Master In Slave Out |
| 7 | CLK | SCL, SCLK |Clock |
| 12 | SS | Chip Select |


> [!TIP]
> Since the *S2 Mini* is pin-compatible to *D1 Mini*, you can simply look up pins for the *D1 Mini* if in doubt. Documentation for *D1 Mini* is much more available than documentation targeting *S2 Mini*.






### Pins And Compatible Shields

The board comes with 32 pins in 2x2 rows of 8. The *outer* pins are *compatible with ESP8266 D1 Mini* pins. *D1 Mini-compatible shields* can be used with the *S2 Mini*:

<img src="images/s2_pins.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

In an effort to maintain *maximum backwards compatibility*, the *S2 Mini* board designers changed the order of some *pin pairs*: pins 2-11* are always designed and located on the board in *pairs*, i.e. *2/3*, *4/5*, *6/7*, *8/9*, *10/11*. For some pins, this scheme is reversed: pins *12* and *13* are located as *13/12* instead of *12/13*.

The reason for this is that only the *outer* pins match the *D1 Mini* pins (as the two inner lines of pins were added). Both pin *11* and *12* are used for the *hardware SPI interface* though. If the board designers would not have switched pins *12* and *13* around, then pin *12* would have been located on the *inner* lines of pins and thus become inaccessible for *D1 Mini*-compatible shields.


<img src="images/esp32_s2_shield_pns_top_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />


This allows users to continue to use i.e. *battery shields* to add *charging* and battery power supply via existing *D1 Mini Shields* for *portable projects*:


<img src="images/esp32_s2_shield_side_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />


> [!CAUTION]
> *Software-configurable* pins (such as *GPIOs* and the pin for the built-in *LED*) are **not compatible** with *ESP8266 D1 Mini*. Since these pins can be adjusted freely in software in the *S2*, converting software from *ESP8266 D1 Mini* to *S2 Mini* is a matter of checking and potentially reassigning pin numbers.

### S2 Mini Pinout


The pin numbers printed on the backside of the breakout board represent the exposed *GPIO* numbers. I.e., pin marked *1* represents *GPIO1*.



| Pin |  Remark | Description |
| --- |  --- | --- |
| EN | | Reset button |
| 3V3 | | direct power supply to CPU |
| VBUS | | connected to ME6211C33 voltage regulator |
| 0 | not exposed | Boot button pulls it low |
| 1-6 |  | general purpose: analog input (ADC1) and digital in/output |
| 7 | SPI SCK | general purpose: analog input (ADC1) and digital in/output |
| 8 | | general purpose: analog input (ADC1) and digital in/output |
| 9 | SPI MISO | general purpose: analog input (ADC1) and digital in/output |
| 10 | | general purpose: analog input (ADC1) and digital in/output |
| 11 | SPI MOSI | general purpose: analog input (ADC2) and digital in/output |
| 12 | SPI SS | general purpose: analog input (ADC2) and digital in/output |
| 13-14 | | general purpose: analog input (ADC2) and digital in/output |

| 17 | DAC1 | general purpose: analog input (ADC2) and digital in/output |
| 18 | DAC2 | general purpose: analog input (ADC2) and digital in/output |
| 19, 20 | not exposed | *USB D1/D2*, connected to the *USB C* connector | 
| 21 | | general purpose digital in/output |
| 33 | I2C SDA | general purpose digital in/output |
| 34 | | general purpose digital in/output |
| 35 | I2C SCL | general purpose digital in/output|
| 36-40 | | general purpose digital in/output |



> [!CAUTION]
> The *ADC2* (and thus *analog inputs* at *GPIO11-GPIO18*) can only be used when *WiFi* is *disabled*.

## Prototyping

The *S2 Mini* uses *dual line header pins* (2x8 pins on both sides for a total of 32 pins).


<img src="images/s2_mini_dual_header_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />


This design was necessary to keep the *hardware compatibility* to the predecessor *ESP8266 D1 Mini* board: the *outer* 8-pin headers match the header pins in a *ESP8266 D1 Mini* (for power and *GND* pins at least).

You cannot of course use *dual line header pins* with a prototyping bread board as this would *short circuiting* both header pin lines.

### Soldering Header Pins

For prototyping, it makes most sense to solder the *outer* header pins normally for a *ESP8266 D1 Mini*-compatible foot print. 


<img src="images/esp32_s2_prototyping_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />


The *inner* header pins should *not be connected* to the bread board. Instead, solder the header pins *on top*: this way, the additional pins can be connected using *female DuPont cables*.




<img src="images/esp32_s2_prototyping2_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />


## Fixing Missing Pins

When programming the *S2 Mini* in *platform.io*, the translation between true *hardware pins* and *common pin labels* is performed automatically: the *IDE* looks up the appropriate version of the file *pins_arduino.h* in the folder *%USERPROFILE%\\.platformio\packages\framework-arduinoespressif32\variants\lolin_s2_mini*.

### Pin Declarations Missing

At the time of this writing, the appropriate file *pins_arduino.h* does exit but is incomplete. It does not define the *common pin labels* for all *digital pins*. 

Whenever you try and compile source code that refers to a **D*x*** pin, compilation files with an exception.

There does not seem to exist an *officially updated version* of this file. To fix, you have two choices:

* **Quick Fix:** Replace the *common pin labels* in the code with the actual *hardware pin* numbers. Since with *S2 Mini* the numbers are identical, you would i.e. change *D2* by *2*. If you do this, the code will compile but is now *specific* for *S2 Mini* and will no longer work on different microcontroller boards.
* **Permanent Fix:** Open the file *%USERPROFILE%\.platformio\packages\framework-arduinoespressif32\variants\lolin_s2_mini\pins_arduino.h* in a text editor, and add the missing declarations. You find an example below. When you do this, you might lose your changes with the next update of the *espressif32 arduino framework*, though.

## Uploading Firmware
These are the steps to upload new firmware to *S2 Mini* using *platformio*:

1. Connect *S2 Mini* to computer using USB-C cable. Make sure to use a *data cable* and not just a *power cable*.
2. Hold button *0*, then short-press button *RST*. Once you release button *RST*, the computer should play the sound for *new USB device discovery*.
3. Upload the firmware in *platformio* by clicking *Upload*. *Platformio* will search for a port, then force the *S2 Mini* in reset, and then find a port and upload the sketch.
4. Once the upload is done, short-press *RST* again. Now, the sketch should execute.

If the *S2 Mini* is *not recognized* by your computer (no "new USB device" sound plays after you pressed the keys as described above), make sure the *USB cable* is fully plugged in, try and reverse the plugs, and use a different cable. Apparently, the *USB connectors* on this board do not always have proper contact. Trying with a different *USB cable* did occasionally solve the issue.

If the issue persists, check to see whether the board gets warmer as usual. The build quality of these boards is not always great, and there have been instances where solder residue was short-circuiting CPU contacts. Closely inspect the board and all solderings.
