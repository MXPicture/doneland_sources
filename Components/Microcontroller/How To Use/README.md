# Programming Microcontrollers 

> All You Need To Know To Successfully Get Started With Microcontroller Boards


In this section I organized all *practical advice* for working with microcontroller *development boards*.

*Development boards* are *great fun* - provided they work as expected, and provided you have already set up a smoothly running development environment. 

Setting up everything right isn't trivial: while it's no *rocket science*, it's far from *intuitive*. You need to *know* the steps required, and assign the correct settings or else you'll quickly end up in *frustration*.

Here are some of the topics I am looking into:

## Development Environment
Choosing and setting up an *IDE* (*Integrated Development Environment*) that you can use to *communicate* with the development board and *write code* for it.

## Connecting To Development Board
Understanding how a *development board* is connected to a computer, and what the *parts* are that participate. It can be simple *USB Plug&Play*, but it can as well cost you days of investigating and a great deal of hair when the board isn't recognized by your computer.
