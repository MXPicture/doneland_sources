# Firmware

> Controls What The Microcontroller Is Supposed To Do

*Firmware* is the *software* that runs *directly* on a microcontroller. It is needed to tell the microcontroller what it should do.

So unless a microcontroller is *already running the required firmware*, you need to upload *new firmware* to it.

Before you can ask your microcontrollers' *boot loader* to download new firmware, you first need a *new firmware file* that is *compatible* to your particular microcontroller (board). 

## Getting Firmware From Someone Else
One of the *easiest* ways is to *get firmware from someone else*. This way, *you don't need to program anything*.

## Creating New Firmware Yourself
One of the *most flexible and powerful* ways is to *write the firmware yourself*. This way, *you can access all microcontroller features*, and tailor the firmware exactly to your needs. You do need to program it yourself, though.
