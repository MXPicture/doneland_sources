# Practical Advise For Microcontroller Boards 

> All You Need To Know To Successfully Get Started With Microcontroller Boards


In this section I have organized all *practical advise* for working with microcontroller *development boards*.

*Development boards* are *great* - when they work as expected, and you have set up a smoothly running development environment. If you just start, setting up everything right isn't trivial: it's no *rocket science*, but it's not *intuitive* as well. You need to *know* the steps and correct configuration in order to set up and enjoy working with *development boards*.

Here are some of the topics I am looking into:

## Development Environment
One of the first things is choosing a *IDE* (*Integrated Development Environment*) that you can use to *communicate* with the development board and *write code* for it.

## Connecting To Development Board
Another typical challenge is *connecting your computer* to a *development board*. It can be as simple as *plugging in a USB cable*, but it can as well cost you days of investigating when the board isn't recognized by your computer.
