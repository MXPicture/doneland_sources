> In 2014, Espressif Entered The DIY Microcontroller Market With The ESP8266. In 2016, Dual-Core ESP32 Were Added. Today, It's A Powerful Processor Family

When the Chinese company *Espressif* in 2014 released its *ESP8266* microcontroller, it became an instant success and started be a serious competition for the *ATMega*-based *Arduino* microcontroller breakout boards.

Since then, Expressif has expanded its *microcontroller* family with many new models. These models can be divided into two sub-families:

* [ESP8266](ESP8266): A cheap and reliable workhorse for *DIY* projects with *WiFi* built-in. Released 2014.
* [ESP32](ESP32): A powerful one- and two-core family of microcontrollers with *WiFi*, *Bluetooth*, *WiFi6*, *Zigbee*, and *Threads* support (depending on *ESP32* model). Initially released 2016, with new models in 2020 and 2021, and ever since.


> [!TIP]
> The *Expressif* **ESP32** microcontrollers are in fact *so powerful and popular* that *Arduino* is using this processor now as well, and released its first **ESP32** board in 2023: the [Nano ESP32](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-esp32/).
