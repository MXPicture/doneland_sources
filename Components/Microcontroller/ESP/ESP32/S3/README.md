# S3

> The Premier ESP32 With Everything On Board That You Can Imagine


The **S3** is the currently *most powerful* **ESP32* family member combining almost all *features* in one chip.

Some infrequently used features like *Hall Sensor* and *DAC* were removed in exchange for 10 more *GPIO* pins, a *temperature sensor*, and *BLE 5.0* support.

## Compared To ESP32 WROOM/WROVER

Here is the list of removed or reduced features compared to **ESP32**:

| Feature | Removal |
| --- | --- |
| Size  | 7x7 instead of 5x5 |
| SRAM  | reduced from 520 to 512 |
| ROM | reduced from 448 to 384 |
| LED PWM | reduced from 16 to 8 |
| DAC | removed |
| SD Slave | removed |
| Hall Sensor | removed |
| Ethernet | Removed |

# New Features

This is what's new:

| Feature | Addition |
| --- | --- |
| Bluetooth | BLE v5.0 instead of BLE v4.2 |
| ADC | increased # of channels from 18 to 20 |
| Touch | 14 instead of 10 |
| Temperature Sensor | added |
| GPIO | extended from 34 to 45 |
| SD Host | extended from 1 to 2 |
| USB OTG | added |

In addition, the **S3** comes with *AI Acceleration Support*: the *MCU* (math coprocessor) is tailored towards the kind of vector calculations needed in *AI* applications.
