# ESP32

> The Original ESP32 Microcontroller Sets New Standards And Comes As WROOM and WROVER



The *original **ESP32*** was launched in 2016 and raised the *feature bar* as mentioned before.

The original **ESP32** was called *WROOM*. A variant with extra *pSRAM* was called *WROVER*. There are dev boards with a built-in *PCB antenna*, and boards with an *IPX connector* to connect a *real external antenna* for more reach.

<sup>**ESP32 WROOM-32D**</sup>

When you purchase **ESP32** dev boards, look for the fine print in the type:

* **WROOM-32:** First version of **ESP32**
* **WROOM-32D:** Revised version of **ESP32** with PCB antenna
* **WROOM-32E:** Same as *WROOM-32D* but with an IPX antenna jack for connecting an external antenna
* **WROVER:** Same as *WROOM-32* but with additional 4/8 MB *pSRAM*
* **WROVER-B:** Same as *WROOM-32D* but with additional 8MB *pSRAM*
* **WROVER-IB:** Same as *WROVER-B* but with an IPX antenna jack instead of a built-in PCB antenna
