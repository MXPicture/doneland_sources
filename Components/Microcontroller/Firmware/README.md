 # Firmware

> Controls What The Microcontroller Is Supposed To Do

*Firmware* is the *software* that runs *directly* on a microcontroller. It tells the microcontroller what tasks to perform and how to perform them. If a microcontroller is not already running the required firmware, you will need to upload *new firmware* to it.

Before instructing your microcontroller's *boot loader* to download new firmware, you must have a *firmware file* that is *compatible* with your specific microcontroller (or board).

## Getting Firmware From Someone Else

One of the easiest ways to get started is by using [*ready-to-use firmware*](https://done.land/components/microcontroller/firmware/fromsomeoneelse/) written by others. This approach allows you to focus on foundational tasks like:

- [Connecting your development board to a PC](https://done.land/components/microcontroller/firststeps/connecttopc/).
- Uploading firmware, which may involve:
  - [Installing necessary drivers](https://done.land/components/microcontroller/firststeps/connecttopc/#installing-drivers).
  - [Switching to bootloader mode](https://done.land/components/microcontroller/firststeps/bootloader/#switching-to-bootloader-mode) by pressing certain buttons, depending on your development board.

By starting with pre-existing firmware, you can simplify the initial setup process and avoid the additional complexity of programming right away.

## Creating New Firmware Yourself

Once you become comfortable handling your microcontroller and performing firmware uploads, you can take the next step: creating your own firmware. This allows you to program your microcontroller with maximum flexibility, tailoring it to meet your specific needs and goals.
