# Lightning Detection

> Detecting Lightning Strikes 

When lightning strikes, it emits strong electromagnetic impulses along with UV radiation emitted by the visible flash. Both can be picked up by sensors.

## Overview
Specialized chips can pick up RF pulses emitted from lightning in the 500kHz region, distinguish them from noise and other sources of electromagnetic impulses, and calculate the distance of the lightning based on radio emission strength. The *AS3935* is such a sensor with a 40km range. The *Boltek LD-250/350* is much more expensive, targeting professional and scientific use cases with a range of hundreds of km.

UV-based approaches use UV sensors to pick up the visible flash associated with lightning. Such solutions have limited range as they rely on the visual aspect.

In addition, there are global open-source networks that share sensor data. Using triangulation, such networks can pinpoint the exact locations of lightning. Without triangulation, single sensors can only determine the distance but not the exact location.
