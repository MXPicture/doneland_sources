# Data Transmission

> Communicating With Other Devices Wired Or Over The Air 

Communication between devices is crucial in many use cases, i.e. to transmit sensor data or remote-control devices such as *garage doors* or *electrical outlets*.

## Wireless

The most common way today uses *wireless* technologies such as *WiFi*, *Bluetooth*, or dedicated *senders* and *receivers* that operate in one of the free and legally usable frequency ranges for *Short Range Devices* (*SRD*).

## Wired

In certain situations, wireless communication may neither be possible nor desireable.

When exceptionally *reliable* or *secure* connections are needed, and when the devices are in physical proximity, a *wired* connection may be the way to go, such as simple *serial interfaces* or more sophisticated *Ethernet* network connections that add a device to a *LAN*.
