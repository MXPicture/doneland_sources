# EV1527 Senders

> Emits EV1527-Compliant Fixed 24-Bit Codes That Can Be Paired With Self-Learning Receivers

*EV1527*-compliant senders come with a built-in *EV1527* encoding chip. They do not need external components or a microcontroller to produce a 24-bit data signal that can control *EV1527*-compliant receivers.

Basically, *EV1527*-compliant senders are what you find in most commercial remote controls.

Breakout boards are a simple solution to build your own *remote controls*. You cannot use these breakout boards to transmit any other type of data, i.e. sensor readings.
