# EV1527 Receivers

> Receives Radio EV1527-Compliant Fixed 24-Bit Codes Sent Out By A Remote Control

*EV1527*-compliant receivers come with a built-in *EV1527* decoding chip. They do not need external components or a microcontroller to interpret a 24-bit data signal sent out by *EV1527*-compliant senders.

These receivers are found in devices that can be remote-controlled via simple *EV1527*-compliant remote controls.

Breakout boards are a simple solution to build your own *remotely controllable devices*. You cannot use these breakout boards to receive any other type of data, i.e. sensor readings.
