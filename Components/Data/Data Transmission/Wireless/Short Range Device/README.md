# Short Range Device

> License-Free Digital Radios With Low RF Output Power Working On 315MHz, 433MHz, 868MHz, And 915MHz

*Short Range Devices* (*SRD*, formerly known as *Low Powered Devices*, *LPD*) operate on *license-free* radio bands, so anyone can operate them almost anywhere on the planet. Their RF output power is stictly limited to low rates such as *10mW* (actual values depending on the region): these devices are good for **short range communication** (from a few hundred meters to a few kilometers), i.e. to transmit sensor data, remote-control a drone, or opening a garage door.

## Overview
*SRDs* operate in four distinct *sub-GHz* frequency ranges: *315MHz*, *433MHz*, *868MHz*, and *915MHz*, and it depends primarily on your geographic location which frequency you may legally use:

* **US:**     
  * **915MHz** most popular
  * **315MHz** used for older and simpler remote controls such as *garage door openers*, has only *one channel*
* **Europe:**
  * **433MHz:** most popular
  * **868MHz:** often used for sophisticated digital transmissions/LoRa. Requires better microcontroller control due to more complex regulatory rules (i.e. duty cycles)


### EV1527 Frequency 

Simple remote controls are often adhering to the *EV1527* standard. In order for such remote controls and fobs to stay compatible, they all work on the same *specific frequency* (per ISM band):

| Frequency | Remark |
| --- | --- |
| 315.00MHz | US (older standard) |
| 433.92MHz | Europe/Asia |
| 868.35MHz | Europe/Asia |
| 915.00Mhz | US/Australia |
