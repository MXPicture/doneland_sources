# SDR (Software Defined Radio)

> Affordable universal receivers allow you to monitor wide frequency spectrums and visualize radio emissions.

Traditional receivers are designed to tune into a specific frequency, meaning you can only monitor one frequency at a time. To listen to a different frequency, you must manually adjust the receiver.

*SDR (Software Defined Radio) receivers*, however, work differently. They capture a wide frequency range, and modern signal analysis software running on a computer can visualize all the signals within that range simultaneously.

This approach is highly beneficial for analyzing and debugging RF (Radio Frequency) devices. You no longer need to know the exact frequency a device is using. For example, if you suspect that a device is operating at the wrong frequency, you can tune your SDR to the approximate range and immediately see the actual frequency in use.

> [!TIP]
> SDR is a broad field, and many HAM radio enthusiasts use SDR receivers to listen to radio stations worldwide. SDR receivers come in various quality levels and price ranges. For lab use, however, a simple SDR USB stick priced around â‚¬20 is often sufficient.

## Overview

Radio waves are invisible, so special tools are required to visualize them in order to analyze and troubleshoot RF components.

For instance, if you're having trouble connecting two RF boards, it helps to verify that both components are indeed using the same radio frequency and modulation. 

Moreover, radio frequencies are regulated, with many restrictions in place. To ensure you stay within legal limits and avoid interfering with other services, you may need to measure the actual RF power your devices emit and check for unwanted spurious emissions.

Lastly, if you're looking to optimize your wireless transmissions, you'll want to assess your antennas. Are they performing as expected? Are they properly tuned for the frequencies you're using?

### SDR Receivers

SDR receivers are relatively simple circuits because most of the heavy lifting is offloaded to a computer. The computer's processor handles the complex signal analysis and visualizes the signals present across the chosen frequency range. 

This is why it's possible to start with a basic and inexpensive SDR receiver. However, the computer itself needs to be powerful enough to process large amounts of data.

The quality and frequency range of the SDR receiver determine how much raw data it sends to the computer. For smooth operation, you need a fast USB connection (at least USB 2.0, but ideally USB 3.0) along with high-quality USB cables.

### Software

In SDR, *software* plays a central role. 

Most SDR software is open-source and free for personal use. These applications are generally of very high quality, but as with many free tools, they may have limitations. For instance, some software may only be available on certain operating systems, depending on the preferences of the software's creator.

Therefore, when choosing *SDR software*, pick one that works well with your preferred operating system. Most SDR software supports the same core functionality.

In this guide, we will use [SDR Console](https://www.sdr-radio.com/), which runs on *Windows PCs*. It is sometimes referred to as *sdr-radio*.

### SDR Radio Devices

A wide variety of *SDR radio devices* are available. These range from affordable USB dongles to high-end, professional models that can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Many popular models are also available as [*cloned* devices](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-quick-start-guide/), which may work just as well, or may not work at all.

Choosing a brand-name SDR radio is important because *hardware drivers* can be the most challenging part of installation. Brand-name products typically come with [quick start guides](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-quick-start-guide/) that provide helpful information and links to necessary drivers.

Clones and unbranded devices often lack adequate support and documentation, which means you may encounter difficulties getting them to work, no matter how inexpensive they are.

## SDR Console (Software) Installation

[SDR Console](https://www.sdr-radio.com/) is a well-regarded SDR software, but it is only available for *Windows PCs*.

    <img src="images/sdr-radio_install9.png" width="80%" height="80%" />

5. During installation, any missing components (e.g., *C++ redistributables*) will be installed. Each component will launch a separate installer, so be sure to click *OK* when prompted.

    <img src="images/sdr-radio_install10.png" width="80%" height="80%" />

6. Once the installation is complete, click *Next*, check the box to *Start the program now*, and click *Finish*.

    <img src="images/sdr-radio_install11.png" width="80%" height="80%" />

This will close the installer and launch *SDR Console*. The program's red round icon with an antenna will appear in your taskbar.

<img src="images/sdr-radio_install12.png" width="80%" height="80%" />

Be sure to right-click this icon and choose *Pin to taskbar* for easy access in the future.

### Adding an SDR Radio Device (Hardware)

For *SDR Console* to work, it needs at least one physical *SDR Radio Receiver*. On the first launch of the software, a dialog box will prompt you to add your SDR receiver.

<img src="images/sdr-radio_install13.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

Follow these steps to add your SDR receiver:

1. Plug in your SDR receiver, so the software can detect it.
2. In the dialog box that opens, click *Search*. A drop-down menu will appear. Select your SDR device (e.g., `RTL Dongle`/`USB`). *SDR Console* will search for your device.

    <img src="images/sdr-radio_install14.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

4. Once the device is detected, click *Add*. The software will automatically populate the technical details of your device, and it will appear in the list of available devices.

    <img src="images/sdr-radio_install15.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

5. Don't forget to click *Save* to keep the device in your list. From now on, you can simply double-click it to select it whenever you launch *SDR Console*.

You can also add additional SDR devices if desired.

### Hardware Not Detected

If *SDR Console* fails to detect your SDR receiver, and you've confirmed that it's connected and the correct model was selected in the *Search* menu, the issue might be related to *USB device discovery*.

Here's how to fix it on a *Windows PC*:

1. Plug your SDR stick into a USB-A port. You should hear the sound indicating that a new device was recognized. Press `WIN`+`R` and type `devmgmt.msc` to open the Device Manager.

2. In Device Manager, check for any *unknown* devices or devices with strange names such as *Other devices*/*Bulk-In*. If you see one, the SDR device may have a USB driver issue.

    <img src="images/sdr-radio_install_sdr_1.png" width="80%" height="80%" />

3. Install [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/), launch it, and select the unknown device from the drop-down list (e.g., *Bulk-In, Interface 0*).

    <img src="images/sdr-radio_zadig1.png" width="80%" height="80%" />

4. In the *Driver* field, check whether a driver is installed. If no driver is present, select *WinUSB* from the drop-down menu and click *Install Driver*. This process may take up to a minute.

After installing the correct USB driver, return to *SDR Console* and try searching for your SDR device again. It should be detected within a few seconds.
## SDR Console - First Steps

Once you have installed *SDR Console* and added your *SDR Radio Device* to it, let's walk through the first steps:

1. **Launch SDR Console**  
   If you pinned *SDR Console* to your taskbar, click its icon. Otherwise, navigate to the installation folder and find *SDR Console.exe*. Launch it.

2. **Select Radio**  
   A *Select Radio* dialog will open, listing all SDR receivers you've previously added. Select the one you want to use.

3. **Set Bandwidth**  
   In the lower part of the dialog, you can select the *bandwidth*. This refers to the frequency range that can be monitored simultaneously in the spectrum. The available bandwidths depend on your SDR receiver's quality and performance. A higher bandwidth requires more computational power and higher data transfer rates. Start with a low bandwidth, such as *1 MHz*, then click *Start*.

     <img src="images/sdrconsole_overview_1.png" width="80%" height="80%" />

4. **Start Listening**  
   After a few seconds, *SDR Console* will start emitting sound, most likely static. By default, it will tune to *7.1 MHz*.

### Listening to Public Broadcast

Now, let's tune into the radio frequency range and modulation type you want to examine. As a first test, tune into *VHF public broadcast*:

<img src="images/sdrconsole_overview_2.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

1. **Set Frequency**  
   Click on the frequency meter in the upper left corner. On each digit, there is a square above and below when you hover the mouse over it. Clicking the square increases/decreases the digit. Tune in your favorite *VHF* radio station, or tune in a frequency in the range of `88-108 MHz`.

2. **Spectrum and Waterfall**  
   The spectrum display will now show any signals that can be picked up in the selected *bandwidth* around the frequency you set. So if you dialed in `100.000.000 MHz` (*100 MHz*), and defined a *1 MHz* bandwidth when launching the software, the spectrum will show all signals in the range `99.5-100.5 MHz`.

   Even if you don't know a particular station's frequency, you can *discover* signals within the monitored spectrum. Simply click on a signal in the spectrum to tune to it.

3. **Modulation**  
   To actually *hear* the public broadcast transmission, you need to set the modulation type to the appropriate one. 

   On the left side, click *Mode*, and from the drop-down, select `W-FM` (*wideband FM*). Done! Now, if youâ€™ve tuned into a radio station and cranked up the volume, you should be able to hear music or news.

---

### Testing RF Remote Controls

Now letâ€™s try something more practical: You may have found an old RF remote control and want to figure out which frequency it uses.

1. **Tune to Suspected Frequency**  
   Set *SDR Console* to the first suspected frequency range, such as `433.920.000` (*433.92 MHz*).

   <img src="images/sdrconsole_overview_3.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

2. **Listen for Signals**  
   Listen for a while. You may pick up various ISM band transmissions, from short bursts from remote controls to regular intervals from digital data transmissions. The waterfall display shows signals over time. If the transmission is on a license-free band, the signals should be centered around *433.92 MHz*.

3. **Test the Remote Control**  
   Press the unknown remote control and check whether it emits a signal in this spectrum. It should produce a much stronger signal, as it is much closer to the receiver.

---

#### Findings

Your remote control may be within the monitored range, but its transmission frequency might be slightly off.

<img src="images/sdrconsole_overview_4.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

The weak signals in the middle of the waterfall come from unknown sources at precisely the center frequency *433.92 MHz*, while the tested remote control transmits around *433.78 MHz*.

> [!TIP]  
> The default waterfall speed is 40 lines per second. To adjust the speed, go to `View` > `Speed`. With the vertical bar on the right side, you can set the sensitivity. Click `Auto` on top to auto-tune the waterfall to the best sensitivity.

You found that your remote control:

* Works
* Uses the *433 MHz* frequency range
* Is slightly off (Â±150 kHz is typical for inexpensive RF remote controls)

If your remote control didnâ€™t produce signals within the monitored spectrum, try switching to other common frequency ranges, such as *315.0 MHz*, and test again.

## Conclusions

The example test cases illustrate the value of *SDR bandwidth*: if an *SDR receiver* were capable of i.e. *200 MHz bandwidth*, it could monitor the full frequency range from, e.g., *300-500 MHz*, picking up remote controls from both ISM bands in one sweep. 

However, such bandwidths are beyond the reach of most affordable SDR receivers:

| SDR Model            | Max Bandwidth (MHz) |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| RTL-SDR (RTL2832U)   | ~2.4 (practical ~2.0) |
| HackRF One           | 20                 |
| LimeSDR Mini         | 30                 |
| LimeSDR USB          | 61.44              |
| USRP B200            | 56                 |
| USRP B210            | 61.44              |
| Airspy R2            | 10                 |
| Airspy Mini          | 6                  |
| SDRplay RSPdx        | 10                 |

With these SDR models, you need to manually switch frequency range once signals fall outside the monitored bandwidth. That's perfectly acceptable, and even a *2 MHz* bandwidth often is overkill for typical RF test scenarios.


*High-performance* SDR receivers, however, can easily achieve broad monitoring:

| SDR Model              | Max Bandwidth (MHz) |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Ettus USRP X310        | 160                 |
| Ettus USRP N320/N321   | 200                 |
| Ettus USRP N210        | 25                  |
| Per Vices Cyan         | 1,600               |
| Per Vices Crimson TNG  | 960                 |
| Per Vices Chestnut     | 500                 |
| NI/Ettus USRP X410     | 400                 |
| Analog Devices AD9361  | 56                  |
| Analog Devices AD9371  | 100                 |
| FlexRadio 6700         | 14 (per receiver, 7 receivers) |
| RFSpace NetSDR         | 1.6                 |
| Signal Hound SM200B    | 160                 |
| R&S PR100              | 10                  |
| R&S EB500              | 20                  |


Regulators also use SDR technology, albeit a bit more powerful [(more similar to this)](https://www.pervices.com/cyan/). That enables easy monitoring and detecting of suspicious RF signals that should not be present in unauthorized frequency ranges.

Another reason why these days you should definitely adhere to legal regulations, and not transmit on frequencies outside legal ranges or with excessive RF power.
