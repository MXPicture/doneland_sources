> Useful Tools To Analyze And Troubleshoot RF Components


Radio waves are invisible, so tools are needed to visualize them in order to understand and also debug RF components.

For example, when you have issues connecting two RF boards, you may want to know whether both components in fact use the same radio frequency and modulation. 

Likewise, radio waves are heavily regulated, and many restrictions apply. To stay within regulatory limits and not interfere with other services, you may want to know the actual RF power your devices emit, and whether they have unwanted spurious emissions in other frequency ranges.

Finally, to optimize your wireless transmissions, you may want to examine your antennas to see how good they actually are, and whether they are really suitable for the frequencies you use.
