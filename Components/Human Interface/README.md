# Human Interface

> **Use Switches, Encoders, Displays, LED and More to Create Awesome Looking and Functional User Interfaces for Your Devices**

In this section I am reviewing the **Human Interface** components I like and use in my projects.

## Input Devices

One of the most versatile and powerful *input user device* is the [Rotary Encoder](Rotary%20Encoder). It requires not much space yet allows users to control even sophisticated menu structures. 

Because of this, [Rotary Encoders](Rotary%20Encoder) are common-place these days in cars and on all kinds of devices. 

## Output Devices

To provide feedback to the user, the most simplistic output device obviously is the **LED**.

If you'd like to provide more (and possibly *textual*) information, the next best thing are **OLED** displays that come in various sizes and resolutions. They are typically controlled by *I2C* so they do not require precious *GPIO* pins, and displays up to roughly one inch are very reasonably priced.
