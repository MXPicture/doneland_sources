# How To Use Displays

> Connecting And Programming Displays

Displays can enhance your DIY projects enormously. In this section you learn how to physically connect displays to your microcontroller, and how to program firmware so you can display text, animations, and videos.


## Overview

Displays can simplify your DIY devices and projects considerably: instead of adding and controlling a wealth of indicator LEDs, you can paint your dashboard on a display. And instead of outputting sensor readings to a terminal, your display can show text or gauges.

If you invest in a *touch screen*, you can even spare yourself individual buttons.

Using displays involves two steps:

1. **Wiring:** you need to connect the display physically to the appropriate pins of your microcontroller. Depending on interface type, this may require as little as four wires or as much as eight wires - with touch capabilities adding another five wires.
2. **Programming:** next, you need to program a firmware that controls what the display shows. Libraries and components can do all the heavy lifting for you.
