# TFT Displays

> Colorful Content And Available In Almost Any Size, TFT Displays Are The Most Economic Solution To Add A Screen To Your Device

A *TFT* (*Thin Film Transistor*) display is a type of *LCD* (*Liquid Crystal Display*) that uses thin film transistor technology to control individual pixels, providing higher image quality and faster refresh rates compared to traditional passive-matrix displays. Most computer displays these days use *TFT technology*.

| Display Technology | Remark |
| --- | --- |
| LCD | Text only, cheap, for outdoors |
| TFT | High resolution color graphics, cheap, readily available in almost any size, for indoors |
| OLED | Very expensive, only *very small* and *monochrome* *OLEDs* are affordable |

## SPI Interface
Almost all *TFT displays* come with a fast [SPI interface](https://done.land/fundamentals/interface/spi) due to the large amount of data that needs to be transferred with their high resolution and color depth.
