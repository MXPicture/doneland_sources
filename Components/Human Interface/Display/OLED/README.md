# OLED Displays

> Awesome Contrast, Great Readability, and Self-Illuminating Pixels

*OLED Displays* use *organic light-emitting diodes* to display pixels. Since each pixel acts as its own *light source*, these displays offer excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, and great readability in both dim and bright daylight.

Common display sizes include *0.48"*, *0.91"*, *0.96"*, *1.3"*, and *1.5"* inches. Resolutions range from *64x48* pixels to (in affordable price ranges) *128x128* pixels.

## Overview

For monochrome displays, *OLED* is an excellent and affordable technology. These displays typically use *I2C* and do not require a separate backlight, making them easy to connect with minimal *GPIO* usage. They are also very power-efficient when displaying content on a black background.

For simple DIY projects, monochrome OLED displays with a resolution of *128x64* pixels and screen sizes of *0.96"* or *1.3"* are widely available and cost as little as â‚¬1.00 per display.

For color displays, however, *TFT* remains the more cost-effective option. While color OLED displays are available, they are significantly more expensive than *TFT*. The same holds true for larger displays above *1.3"*.

> [!NOTE]
> Since in *OLED displays*, **each pixel** is an independent **light source**, power consumption depends on the number of pixels *on*. Content on a *black background* is more energy-efficient than *inverted displays* where the background is actively lit. For mixed content, *OLED displays* typically use *40-60%* of the energy a comparable *TFT display* would require.

### Caveats

There are two key challenges with *OLED displays*:

- **Limited Life-Span:** The *organic* materials in OLEDs degrade over time, leading to reduced brightness, particularly with *blue* OLEDs. This degradation typically becomes noticeable after more than 10,000 hours of use. For most *DIY projects*, this is not a concern unless the device is designed to remain always on without implementing screen saver logic.
- **Burn-In/Ghosting:** *OLED displays* are susceptible to image retention (burn-in, also known as *ghosting*) when static images are displayed for long periods. This can be a realistic problem in *DIY projects* where displays often show static layouts.

#### Workarounds

Both of these shortcomings can be mitigated by turning *OLED displays* off when not in use. This approach is similar to how many *OLED*-based smartwatches and smartphones operate. It also conserves power.

Here is the typical behavior for such devices:

- When there is information to display, the firmware turns the display on.
- After a set period of inactivity, the display automatically turns off (or dims).
- Users can press a key on the device to turn the display back on at any time.



### Comparison
Let's compare key facts of OLED and TFT displays:

| Feature               | OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode)                     | TFT (Thin Film Transistor LCD)                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Display Quality**   | Excellent contrast with true blacks (no backlight).     | Good, but blacks are less true due to backlight. |
| **Brightness**        | High brightness in dark environments but may fade in direct sunlight. | Can be brighter and more sunlight-readable with reflective layers. |
| **Power Efficiency**  | More power-efficient for mostly black screens (each pixel lights individually). | Backlight always on, consuming constant power regardless of image. |
| **Lifespan**          | Organic materials degrade over time, reducing lifespan, especially for blue pixels. | Generally longer lifespan without image burn-in issues. |
| **Viewing Angles**    | Wide viewing angles with consistent colors.             | Often good but may suffer from color shifts depending on panel type (e.g., TN, IPS). |
| **Refresh Rate**      | Very high, suitable for animations and fast updates.    | High, but can be slightly slower for complex graphics. |
| **Cost**              | Generally more expensive per unit size.                | More affordable and available in larger sizes. |
| **Ease of Use**       | Simple to wire and program; fewer connections for small sizes. | Requires more connections (backlight, control pins). |
| **Availability**      | Limited to smaller sizes (<3 inches typical).          | Wide range of sizes (from small to large).     |
| **Durability**        | Fragile; can be damaged by static or environmental factors (moisture). | More robust but may need additional care for backlight longevity. |
| **Color Accuracy**    | Vivid and vibrant colors.                               | Accurate but less vibrant compared to OLED.   |
| **Use Cases**         | Ideal for low-power, compact projects with sharp visuals. | Best for larger displays or applications requiring high brightness. |
| **Drawbacks**         | Risk of burn-in for static images, shorter lifespan for some colors. | Bulkier due to backlight, slightly less contrast. |
### Recommendation
Typical *0.96"* and *1.3"* monochrome OLED displays are an excellent and affordable choice for many DIY projects: they are easy to integrate, have good support, and offer sharp, crisp display quality.

If you require multi-color displays, larger sizes, or need a display to operate continuously for extended periods (days or months), *TFT* displays may be a better and more economical choice.

## OLED Driver Chips
*OLED displays* require a *driver chip* to interpret display information and draw it to the screen. Understanding the *driver chip* used on a particular *OLED breakout board* is crucial, as the chip determines which *software library* you need for your project.

Drivers support both *I2C* and *SPI* interfaces. Monochrome displays often use the simpler two-wire *I2C* interface due to the lower data transfer requirements. Grayscale and color displays, which need to handle more data, typically rely on the faster *SPI* interface. The interface type is usually fixed by the breakout board design.

> [!NOTE]
> The driver lists below highlight only the most commonly used drivers; many more exist. If unsure, consult the specific driver's data sheet.

### Monochrome Displays
Small monochrome OLED displays have recently become very affordable, thanks in part to cost-effective drivers like the *SH1106* and *SH1107*. These drivers are excellent for basic use cases, such as displaying text and static images.

However, certain drivers, like the *SH1106*, lack built-in hardware features for scrolling and animations. While such features may not be critical for typical DIY projects, if your project requires them, you may prefer the older but more capable *SSD1306* or *SSD1307*.

The *SSD1315* is a refined version of the *SSD1306*, offering improved brightness and contrast, making it a great choice for projects where enhanced visibility is essential.

### Grayscale Displays
These drivers support 16 levels of grayscale, enabling more detailed images and modern UI designs. However, grayscale OLED displays come with certain trade-offs compared to their monochrome counterparts:

- **Price:** Grayscale displays are considerably more expensive.
- **Efficiency:** They consume more power due to the additional data handling and active pixels.
- **Refresh Rate:** Grayscale displays often have slower refresh rates, though this is typically not an issue when displaying static text.



|Driver|Resolution Support|Color Support|Interface Types|Unique Features/Benefits|Limitations Compared to Others|Common Applications|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|SSD1327|Up to 128x128|Grayscale (16 levels)|I2C,SPI| ||Graphical interfaces, detailed UIs.|
|SSD1322|Up to 256x64|Grayscale (16 levels)|SPI|Wide horizontal resolution, suited for panoramic or dashboard displays.||Audio players, control panels.|
|SSD1325|Up to 128x64|Grayscale (16 levels)|SPI|Mid-range grayscale resolution for detailed yet simple graphics.|Lower grayscale resolution than SSD1327; slower refresh rates.|Basic grayscale graphical displays.|

### Color Displays
OLED color displays are significantly more expensive than their monochrome counterparts: while a simple monochrome display can cost as little as *1.00â‚¬*, a full-color display of the same size typically costs *5-10x* more.

- **SSD1331:** An entry-level driver that provides vibrant and excellent display quality but is limited to smaller resolutions.
- **SSD1351:** Supports reasonable resolutions of up to *128x128* pixels, making it suitable for more detailed color applications.
- **SEPS525:** Unique for its higher resolution, though it is uncommon in DIY projects.
- **RA8875:** Capable of driving displays with resolutions up to VGA, but it is even rarer in DIY applications due to its specialized nature.
