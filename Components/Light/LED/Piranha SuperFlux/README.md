# Piranha / SuperFlux

> Rugged, Square And Very Bright: These LED Serve In Break Lights And Other Places Where Visibility Matters



*Piranha* **LED** are small and compact *square* **LED** with a relatively large *light output* with *four* pins (instead of *two*). They are also known as *SuperFlux*.

Similar to *Straw Hat* **LED**, they have a *built-in lens* for a *wide viewing angle* but are even *brighter* than the latter. There are even *high performance piranha* **LED** available that internally use two light emitting chips.

## Anode and Cathode

To identify *anode* and *cathode*, closely examine the *piranha* **LED**. Use a *magnifying glass* if at hand.

* **Anodes:** On one side you can identify two *holes*. The pins on this side are the *anodes* (**+**).
* **Cathodes:** One *edge* is *rounded*. When you look at the **LED** from the top and place the *rounded edge* to the *lower right* side, then the *bottom pins* are the *cathodes*

The picture shows both the *rounded edge* and the two *cathode* pins from a different angle. The *rounded edge* is positioned at the *lower right*, so the two pins seen in the picture are the *cathodes*.

> [!TIP]
> Typically, both *anodes* and both *cathodes* are internally connected. You need to connect only *one* *anode* and *cathode*, and use only *one series resistor*.
> With the *high performance multi-chip piranha* **LED**, all pins must be wired.

## Intended Use

*Piranha* **LED** are often used in *automotive* use cases where a *robust* and *very bright* light with a *wide viewing angle* is needed, i.e. in *brake lights*.

Even though not required with the *regular* types, for added robustness you can connect *anode* and *cathode* with two separate wires each.

Here you can see the *built-in lens* on to of the housing that is designed to emit the light in almost all directions (wide viewing angle):
