# TM1637
> Controls Up To Six 8-Segment LED Displays Or 48 Individual LED And Comes With Keyboard Scan Capabilities, Too

The *TM1637* controller is a clever **LED** *controller* used in many *7-segment **LED** displays*.

> [!TIP]
> What sets this controller apart from others is its *two-wire* serial interface and the built-in *keyboard scan* support which can make this controller a one-stop solution to control *device user interfaces* consisting of *indicator **LED*** and *keys*.

## LED Driver

*MAX7219* lets you flexibly control the connected **LED**:

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Common Anode | **LED** are controlled by their *cathode* (**-**) and all use the same *anode* (**+**) |


## Interface

*TM1637* supports a simple 2-wire *serial interface*. 


## Breakout Boards

Typically, the *MAX7219* comes on a breakout board ready-to-use with *7-segment* displays:
