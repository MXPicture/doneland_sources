# LED (Light Emitting Diodes)

> LEDs Can Be Flexibly Shaped, Produce Light In Any Color Efficiently, Last Forever and Cost Very Little

**LED**s (*light emitting diodes*) are *semiconductors* that work like a *diode* but emit *light*.

Their conversion of electric power to *light* is so efficient that **LED** typically do not produce *heat* (very high powered **LED** still do): they are said to produce *cold light*.


## Rugged Yet Simple to Destroy

**LED** are *rugged* and last longer and are *more resilient* to *mechanical* stress than most other light sources. 

One pecularity makes them very *delicate and sensitive*, though: they have a *low internal resistance*. When you connect **LED** directly to a power source can *instantly destroy* them. The **LED** *low resistance* behaves like a wire that you use to *short-circuit* your power supply: for a fraction of a second, a *huge current* flows and causes your **LED** to burn up, almost like a *fuse*.

**You must always limit the *current* that you supply to a LED**. 

[Read more here](Current) to find out *how* you can safely control the **LED** *current* and *calculate the resistance* for a *series resistor*. You'll also learn more on using *constant voltage* or *constant current* to drive single **LED** as well as **LED Strips**.

## Standard Hobbyist LEDs

Anyone in electronics has come across the classic standard LEDs that typically come in two diameters: 3mm and 5mm:

The picture shows already wired **LED**, and you can identify the *resistor* that was added to one leg of the **LED**. These **LEDs** were already tailored to work with a specific voltage.

*Indicator* **LED** exist in many different shapes and forms and can also be *square*, *clear* or *fogged*. They all work the same.

### Anode and Cathode

It is important to connect **+** and **-** to the correct "legs" of the **LED**. With most **LED**, one "leg" is *shorter* than the other.

* **Anode (+):** the **longer** leg is connected to the *anode* and needs a *positive* voltage
* **Cathode (-):** the **shorter** leg is connected to the *cathode* and needs a connection to *ground*

> [!TIP]
> You can identify the *anode* even when **LEDs** are already *wired* or the "legs" have been cut and shortened.       
> Look inside the **LED** head: you'll identify a *wider* metal part, and a relatively *short* pin. The *short* pin is connected to the *anode* (**+**), and the wider *triangle*-like part is connected to the *cathode* (**-** or **GND**)
