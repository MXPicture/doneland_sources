# LED (Light Emitting Diodes)

> LEDs Can Be Flexibly Shaped, Produce Light In Any Color Efficiently, Last Forever and Cost Very Little

**LED**s (*light emitting diodes*) are *semiconductors* that work like a *diode* but emit *light*.

Their conversion of electric power to *light* is so efficient that **LED** typically do not produce *heat* (very high powered **LED** still do): they are said to produce *cold light*.


## Rugged Yet Simple to Destroy

**LED** are very *rugged* and last much longer than most other light sources. Still you can easily *destroy* them because of one pecularity:

**LED** have a *very low* internal *resistance*: when you supply unlimited power to them, a *high current* flows, almost as if you had *short-circuited* your wires.

In this case, **LED** suffer the same fate as any thin wire: they *glow away* in a fraction of a second and are destroyed forever.

**You must always limit the *current* that you supply to a LED**. [Read more here](Current) to find out how you can safely control the **LED** *current* and calculate the *resistance* for appropriate *series resistors*, or use *constant voltage* or *constant current* power supply.

## Standard Hobbyist LEDs

Anyone in electronics has come across the classic standard LEDs that typically come in two diameters: 3mm and 5mm:

The picture shows already wired **LED**, and you can identify the *resistor* that was added to one leg of the **LED**. These **LEDs** were already tailored to work with a specific voltage.

*Indicator* **LED** exist in many different shapes and forms and can also be *square*, *clear* or *fogged*. They all work the same.

### Anode and Cathode

It is important to connect **+** and **-** to the correct "legs" of the **LED**. With most **LED**, one "leg" is *shorter* than the other.

* **Anode (+):** the **longer** leg is connected to the *anode* and needs a *positive* voltage
* **Cathode (-):** the **shorter** leg is connected to the *cathode* and needs a connection to *ground*

> [!TIP]
> You can identify the *anode* even when **LEDs** are already *wired* or the "legs" have been shortened, and you cannot see the original difference in length anymore.    
> Look inside the **LED** head: you'll identify a *wider* metal part, and a relatively *short* one. The *short* one belongs to the *anode* (**+**)
