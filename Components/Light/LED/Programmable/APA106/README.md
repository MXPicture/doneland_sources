# APA106

> Dedicated Single-LED Controller for RGB LEDs

The *APA106* is a controller very similar to the popular *WS2812B* controller ("NeoPixel"). However, it is almost exclusively found in *single* **LED**. The *APA106* is typically not used in **LED** *strips*.

## When To Use

When you are looking for *individual programmable **LED***, i.e. as smart *indicator **LED***, or to build a *big screen* **LED** panel, the *APA106* is a good choice, sharing the primary specs with the *WS2812B*.


## When To Not Use

The *APA106* is almost exclusively available as *single **LED*** only. If you need other **LED** types (i.e. *SMD* **LED**), you won't find such with *APA106*. Use *WS2812B* instead.
