> The Most Popular LED Controller Takes 5V, Can Control RGB LED And Daisy-Chain Using One Wire

The *WS2812* was the first *truly embedded* **LED** controller integrated right into *SMD* (and other) **LED**.

This was a huge success, and the controller underwent a number of revisions to further improve it.

Today the *WS2812B* is the *most popular* and widely used controller type. 

> [!TIP] 
> The American company *Adafruit* even minted a new marketing name for it: *NeoPixel*. *NeoPixels* are no different from other *WS2812B* based **LED**, though.
