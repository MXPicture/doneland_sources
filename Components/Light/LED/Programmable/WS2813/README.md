# WS2813

> Like A WS2812 But With Dual Data Line For Added Protection

The *WS2813* is not nearly as widely used as the *WS2812B* because of its higher price and limited innovation.

It's fundamental *advantage* is an additional second data line that acts as a fallback should one controller in a string fail.

All the other *WS2813* improvements like a higher *refresh rate* were silently back-ported to the *WS2812*, too.

## When To Use

*WS2813* can be used interchangeably with the *WS2812*. 

Whenever the installation of *WS2812* does not allow for later servicing, or when you need very *high reliability*, then investing in *WS2813* and its second data line can be a good idea.

## When To Not Use

For hobbyist projects or any other scenario where you can easily replace **LED**, you do not need a second fallback data wire.

Use the *WS2812B* instead.
