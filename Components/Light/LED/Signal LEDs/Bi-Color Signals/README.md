# Single-GPIO Bi-Color Signals

> Designing A Bi-Color Signal Driven By A Single GPIO

Microcontroller *GPIOs* are often used to turn some functionality *on* or *off*, so these *GPIOs* have *two* states.

When you want to *signal* this state, your microcontroller can handle this and i.e. use additional *GPIOs* to drive *signal LEDs*, or even use *displays*. This however adds complexity to the microcontroller programming, and requires additional *GPIOs*.

In this article, I am looking at signal state *LED* that require **no** additional programming and **no** additional *GPIOs*. 

## Design Approaches

Here are the design approaches discussed:


* [Using two separate LEDs on one GPIO](https://done.land/components/light/led/signalleds/bi-colorsignals/twoseparateled)
* [Using a bi-polar bi-color LED](https://done.land/components/light/led/signalleds/bi-colorsignals/bipolarbicolorled)
* Using a RGB or three-legged bi-color LED
