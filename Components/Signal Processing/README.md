# Signal Processing

> Manage And Control Signals With Active Components

*Signal Processing Components* can be as simple as *transistors* or even *relais* and *mechanical switches*, may be more integrated circuits like *operational amplifiers* or even *dc motor controls*, or are fully programmable *microcontrollers*.

They all are *active components* that take some input signal and process it in one way or another:

* Transistors
* Switches and Relais
* Operational Amplifiers (OpAmps)
* DC Motor Control drivers
* Logic ICs
* Microcontrollers

Grouping components is always arbitrary and biased. *Voltage Regulators* for example could also fit into this category. However, since power supplies (including voltage regulators) are a huge field with high importance for DIY Makers, anything related to *power supplies* is located in its own primary section.
