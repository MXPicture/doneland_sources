# Storage

> Storing Sensor Data on SD Cards or Memory, Keeping Variables During Reboots, and Anything Else Around Safekeeping Your Data

Storing data is essential for many projects. In this section you learn your various options.

## Permanent Storage

If you'd like to keep data (i.e. sensor data) safe even during power losses or reboots, you need a way of *permanent storage*.

### SD Cards

Probably the easiest and most versatile method is to use cheap **SD Cards**. They provide gigabytes of storage volume and cost only a few bucks. Maybe you want to even recycle an old **SD Card** from your old camera.

To read and write to **SD Cards**, you need an [SD Card Reader](Permanent/On%20SD%20Cards). They are really cheap to get at around 1 Euro. [Here is an article](Permanent/On%20SD%20Cards) with all the details you need to know to hook up an **SD Card Reader** to your project.
