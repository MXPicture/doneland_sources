# FM Public Broadcast Senders

> Sending On Wide-FM Public Broadcast Frequencies: 87.5-108MHz 

FM Broadcast *sender* boards are illegal to operate in most countries of the world (unless you are a licensed public broadcast station).

They are still produced and in use to interface audio input devices such as *MP3* players or *smartphones* with *car radios* that have no  auxiliary audio input.

Due to the very low RF emission of such breakout boards, chances of interference are minimal, and the reach of these devices is just a few meters.

Regardless, operating such devices is illegal in most countries, and certainly in the *EU*.
