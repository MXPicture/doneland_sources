# FM Public Broadcast

> Devices To Receive Or (Illegally) Transmit On VHF Public Broadcast Band

The *VHF public broadcast band* is strictly reserved for *licensed public broadcast senders* and stretches from *88-108MHz*.

Listening (*receiving*) to these frequency of course is legal. Transmitting is not.

This section discusses breakout boards to *receive* (and to *send*, which would be illegal to do in most regions of the world).

## Quick History

In 1936, the *US* established the first public broadcast band in the frequency range *42-50MHz* but abandoned it in 1946.

The FCC then assigned the *88-108MHz* band to *FM* public broadcast stations. By 1957, this was codified into 101 channels with a *200kHz* bandwidth, and the provision that one unused channel sits between geographically close senders.

In Europe, both *100kHz* and *200kHz* channel spacings are used.

## Receivers

*Receivers* basically work like *radio sets*. Breakout boards are *tiny* and allow easy integration of *FM public broadcast reception*.

## Senders

Most available *FM Broadcast Band Senders* have tiny *RF emission* and are not designed to start your own illegal *public broadcast station* or *pirate sender*.

Rather, these senders were invented to use an easy way of connecting external audio sources (like *MP3*-players or *smartphones*) to *car radios* that have no other auxiliary audio input.

The external audio source instead *transmits* its audio signal on a *public broadcast frequency*, and the *car radio* can pick it up like any other station.

This works because of the close vicinity of *sender* and *receiver*. Due to the very small *RF emission*, the signal won't reach far and cause interference.

Regardless, this use case is illegal in most countries of the world.
