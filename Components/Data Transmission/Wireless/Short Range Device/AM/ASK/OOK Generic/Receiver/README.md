> Receiving AM Radio Signals Using Digital ASK Modulation: Receiving Data From Sensors Or Remote Controls

*ASK-Receivers* receive *AM* (*Amplitude Modulation*) radio waves for *digital communication*: they use *ASK* (*Amplitude-Shift keying*) to receive encoded bits or symbols.


*ASK-Receivers* can receive any *ASK*-encoded digital information. This is what makes them very versatile:

* **Remote Control Solutions:** if you want to make a device remote controllable, add a *ASK* receiver that can pick up a signal sent by a *remote control*. With generic *ASK* receivers (as discussed here), you will also need a microcontroller programmed to *decode* the *EV1527*-encoded messages sent out by the *remote control*. For simple solutions without a microcontroller, you better get a dedicated *EV1527 receiver* that comes with a *EV1527 encoder* on-board.
* **Data Transmission:** for one-way digital data transmission, you can place a *ASK receiver* on the receiving side. For example, a sensor can use a *ASK sender* to send sensor data, and at a central place, a *ASK receiver* can be attached to a microcontroller to gather all sensor data from various sensors.
