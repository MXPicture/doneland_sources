> Sending AM Radio Signals Using Digital ASK Modulation: Simple Remote Controllers

*ASK-Senders* are *AM* (*Amplitude Modulation*) transceivers for *digital communication*: they use *ASK* (*Amplitude-Shift keying*) to encode bits or symbols.

*ASK-Senders* are the core of most commercial *remote controllers*. 

While pure *ASK-Senders* can transmit any *ASK*-encoded digital information, a *subgroup* of these often adheres to the *EV1527* (or similar) standard that can be understood by *self-learning* remotely controlled devices such as *garage door openers* or *remote controlled plugs*.
