# AM (Amplitude Modulation)

> Information Is Modulated On The Radio Wave Amplitiude. The Frequency Stays Fixed.

*AM* in *DIY Projects* is used with cheap remote controls: *ASK* (*Amplitide-Shift keying*) is a digital adaption of *AM* where - in its simplest form (*OOK*, *On-Off-Keying*) - the bit *1* is represented as a signal with *full amplitude*, and the bit *0* is represented by the absence of a signal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to communicate with remote controls or remotely controlled devices compliant with *EV1527*, you need an *AM* sender and receiver.



## History

Initially, *Amplitude Modulation* was the dominant modulation scheme when radio communication was discovered: it is simple to build, and receivers are simple to make.

Today, *AM* is still used for simple digital communication (*ASK*), with some *short wave radio stations*, in free *CB* (*citizen band*) radio, and as one-sided variant (*SSB*, *single side band*) by *radio amateurs*.

The most important use cases for *AM* today are *aviation* and *simple digital data transmission* (*ASK* modulation).


### Disadvantages

It did not take long before important disadvantages associated with *AM* modulation became obvious:

* **Inefficient:** *AM* needs much energy to provide a constant carrier signal onto which the *amplitudes* can be modulated. Less that 18% of RF power are used to carry information. Since amplitudes swing both ways, and both positive and negative amplitudes carry the same information, 50% of bandwidth (today: scarce allocatable frequencies) is wasted.
* **Jamming and Noise:** The amplitude that is carrying the information can easily be jammed by sending a jammer signal slightly offsetting the carrier frequency. *Selective carrier loss* over great distances can make the signal unreadable. Lightning and any other source of *sparks* massively interfere with *AM*.

Today, *AM* is *technically obsolete* and replaced by the more efficient and cheaper *FM* technology.


## Advantages

*AM* has a few *advantages* over other modulations which in part is the reason why *AM* is still used in some areas, i.e. for *remote controls* and in *aviation*:

* **Distance:** *AM* can travel long distances and penetrate buildings better than *FM*. This is valuable both for *aviation* and for *remote controls*.
* **Capture Effect:** When multiple parties talk at the same time, with *AM* all parties can still be heard (amplitudes just mix, and weaker stations are just a bit quieter than stronger stations). In *FM*, the *capture effect* lets only *the strongest* station come through.
