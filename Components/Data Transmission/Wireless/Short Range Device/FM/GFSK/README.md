# Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK)

> FSK With Preprended Gaussian Filter For More Advanced Data Transmission

*GFSK* is an evolution of *FSK* (read *FSK* first, then come back). 

*GFSK* modulation is used in many modern communications technologies, i.e. *Bluetooth*, *DECT*, some *WiFi*.

Put short, while *FSK* works with simple *On/Off* signals similar to square waves, feeding the signal through a *gaussian filter* produces smoother transitions. These in turn have important electromagnetic advantages.

## Benefits

* **Efficiency:** *GFSK* requires less *bandwidth* and increases *spectral efficiency*. As a direct consequence, this also conserves energy and requires less power to transmit the same information.
* **Less Interference:** there is a smoother transistion between *1* and *0* states, reducing spectral splatter and adjacent channel interference.
* **Stability:** Smoother frequency transitions and reduced interference in turn reduce noise and allow reliable data transmission even at high speeds.

## Differences To FSK

*GFSK* is actually an enhanced *FSK*, so both modulators are technically almost identical, except for one detail: the pulses pass a *gaussian filter* before they enter the *FSK* modulator.
