# GFSK-Transceivers

> High-Speed Digital Data Transmission 

*Transceivers* can both *send* and *receive*. 

*GFSK-Transceivers* are *FM* (*Frequency Modulation*) transceivers for *digital communication*: they use *GFSK* (*Gaussian Frequency-Shift keying*) to encode bits or symbols.

## Overview

*GFSK* is an evolved *FSK* modulation designed to efficiently transmit data at high data rates and without causing much interference.

*GFSK* is used commericially for example in *Bluetooth* and *DECT* wireless phones.

## Use Cases

*GFSK transceiver breakout boards* can use the same fundamental technology for high-speed custom-protocol data transmission.

Essentially, they provide the core transmission protocol without any other and more specific data protocols (such as *Bluetooth* or *DECT*).

This way, you can use your own libraries and/or create light-weight custom protocols to transfer large amounts of data reliably. 

*GFSK* (and the powerful breakout boards supporting it) are perfectly suited to transmit data-intensive payloads (such as video) over distances of 300-1000m without the need of any supporting infrastructure.

## When Not To Use

If you need to transmit only small amounts of data (i.e. temperature sensor data or remote control commands), you should rather fall back to simple and inexpensive *FSK* or *ASK* transceivers.
