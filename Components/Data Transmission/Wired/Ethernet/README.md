# Ethernet

> Connecting Microcontrollers Permanently To Networks Using Ethernet Cables 

*Wired* network connection may be necessary if you want to permanently connect a microcontroller in the most robust way. While many microcontrollers these days come with *wireless* connectivity built-in, rarely do you find microcontroller boards with *Ethernet* adapters.

## Ethernet Adapter Boards
Adding *Ethernet* connectivity is *cheap* and *simple*. There are ready-to-use *Ethernet* breakout boards that come with the *RJ45* jack to plug in typical *CAT* cables.

At the heart of an *Ethernet* breakout board is the *Ethernet* controller:

* [ENC28J60](ENC28J60): *Ethernet* breakout board based on the *ENC28J60* controller using a **SPI** interface and running on **3.3V**
