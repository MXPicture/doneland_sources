# Ethernet

> Connecting Microcontrollers To Wired LANs (Local Area Networks)  

*Wired* network connection may be necessary if you want to permanently connect a microcontroller to a *LAN* in the most robust way. While many microcontrollers these days come with *wireless* connectivity built-in, rarely do you find microcontroller boards with *Ethernet* adapters.

> [!TIP]
> *Wired connections* may even be *required* for certain use cases: if you'd like to *wake up computers* in your *LAN* using *WOL* (*Wake-On-LAN*), the *magic packets* that do the wakeup need to be sent to the *wired* network. You cannot wake up other computers via *WOL* with a *WiFi* device.

## Ethernet Adapter Boards
Adding *Ethernet* connectivity is *cheap* and *simple*. There are ready-to-use *Ethernet* breakout boards that come with the *RJ45* jack to plug in typical *CAT* cables.

At the heart of an *Ethernet* breakout board is the *Ethernet* controller:

* [ENC28J60](ENC28J60): *Ethernet* breakout board based on the *ENC28J60* controller using a **SPI** interface and running on **3.3V**
