# Power Supply

> Clever Ideas For Supplying Power To Your Breadboard

When you plug components into a *breadboard* and wire them up, at some point it is *show time* and you want to *run* the circuit. That of course requires a power supply.

## Via Microcontroller Board

*Microcontroller*-based circuits are often powered directly through the *microcontroller board* which typically comes with a *USB connector* (for power input) and pins to output *5V* and *3.3V*. 

## Via Bench Power Supply

If you own a quality bench power supply you can supply the *+* and *-* rail of your breadboard directly from such a power supply:

* **Voltage:** Set the bench power supply to the desired output voltage (typically *5V*)
* **Constant Current:** Set the bench power supply *constant current* to *less than 1A* as a safety measure. Circuits typically require much less than *1A*. Should there be a circuit error or an accidenal short, then *constant current* protects you from damaging high currents.

## Dedicated Breadboard Power Supply

Adding a *dedicated power supply* to your breadboard is simple, cost-effective, safe and above all very convenient. Solutions exist that plug directly onto the breadboard, can be powered from a wide variety of power sources, and cost little.
