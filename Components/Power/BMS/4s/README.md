# 4S - Using 4 Batteries in Series

> 4S BMS Protect Four (Groups of) Batteries From Mishap. Combined With Balancing They Are A Perfect Fit For Your Batteries.

A **4S BMS** is needed to protect *four* batteries (or groups of batteries connected *in parallel*) that are connected *in series*. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> **BMS** often ship in *locked state*: *no output voltage* is available at the output pins. 
> *Locked state* is entered whenever *over-current protection* was triggered. 
> To *unlock* the **BMS**, connect it to a charger. If you did not add a dedicated *charger board*, apply the appropriate charging voltage to its output terminal.



> [!CAUTION]
> When connecting batteries to your **BMS**, make sure you use *wires* with sufficient diameter for the anticipated *high currents*.
> Also make sure you only use batteries of *same type* and *same state of charge*. It is recommended you *fully charge* all batteries before connecting. All batteries must have *the same voltage* (voltage difference less than *0.05V*). Do not mix batteries from different vendors, types, capacity, or age. 



## List of 4S BMS

Here is a list of actual **4S BMS** breakout boards, separated by *maximum current*:

* [BMS 4S 8A](8A)
* [BMS 4S 15A](15A)
* [BMS 4S 25A](25A)
