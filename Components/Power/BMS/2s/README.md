# 2S - Using 2 Batteries in Series
:stopwatch: Reading time: 10 minutes.

## Overview

*2S* is short for *2 strings* and describes a power source where two batteries are working in series.

With the voltage range of 3.7V-4.2V for LiIon and LiPo batteries, this results in a voltage between 7.2V-8.4V.

To safely operate *2S* battery packs, you can add a cheap and powerful *BMS* system:

* [Small loads (up to 3A)](small)   
* [Medium loads (up to 8A)](medium)
