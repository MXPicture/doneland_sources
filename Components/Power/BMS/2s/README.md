# 2S - Using 2 Batteries in Series

> 2S BMS Protect Two (Groups of) Batteries From Mishap. Combined With Balancing They Are A Perfect Fit For Your Batteries.

A **2S BMS** is needed to protect *two* batteries (or groups of batteries connected *in parallel*) that are connected *in series*. 



> [!NOTE]
> **BMS** often ship in *locked state*: *no output voltage* is available at the output pins. 
> *Locked state* is entered whenever *over-current protection* was triggered. 
> To *unlock* the **BMS**, connect it to a charger. If you did not add a dedicated *charger board*, apply the appropriate charging voltage to its output terminal.



> [!CAUTION]
> When connecting batteries to your **BMS**, make sure you use *wires* with sufficient diameter for the anticipated *high currents*.
> Also make sure you only use batteries of *same type* and *same state of charge*. It is recommended you *fully charge* all batteries before connecting. All batteries must have *the same voltage* (voltage difference less than *0.05V*). Do not mix batteries from different vendors, types, capacity, or age. 

## List of BMS

Here is a list of actual **BMS** breakout boards, separated by *maximum current*:

* [BMS 2S 3A](3A)
* [BMS 2S 8A](8A)
* [BMS 2S 10A](10A)
* [BMS 2S 20A](20A)
