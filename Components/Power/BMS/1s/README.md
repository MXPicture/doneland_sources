# 1S - Protecting Single Batteries 

> 1S BMS Protect One (Groups of) Batteries From Mishap.

Single batteries often come with a *basic* **BMS** built-in. If you want more control over the protection features, you can select and add your own **1S BMS** according to your needs.

If you connect multiple batteries *in parallel* to build a battery pack with more power, you should always add your own **1S BMS**.


## 5A

For currents up to **5A**, you can use a very simple **BMS**:

Its long metal sleeves are designed to be fitted to *18650 LiIon Cells* using spot welding but you can shorten the connector terminals and solder them to *LiPo* as well.

On the backside, there are two terminals marked **B+** and **B-** that are identical to the metal sleeves and go to the battery.

The output voltage is available at the terminals **P+** and **P-** in the middle of the backside.
