# 1S - Protecting Single Batteries 

> 1S BMS Protect One (Group of) Batteries From Mishap.

Single batteries often come with a *basic* **BMS** built-in. If you want more control over the protection features, you can select and add your own **1S BMS** according to your needs.

If you connect multiple batteries *in parallel* to build a battery pack with more power, you should always add your own **1S BMS**.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> **BMS** often ship in *locked state*: *no output voltage* is available at the output pins. 
> *Locked state* is entered whenever *over-current protection* was triggered. 
> To *unlock* the **BMS**, connect it to a charger. If you did not add a dedicated *charger board*, apply the appropriate charging voltage to its output terminal.
