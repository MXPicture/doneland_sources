# Measuring Current

> Current Is Measured Indirectly: Voltage Drop or Magnetic Fields Are Used To Calculate Current

There are *two* physical effects caused by *current*. These effects are *proportional* to the amount of current flow. That's why almost any current meter in the world is measuring either one of these two effects to *indirectly* determine the current:

* [**Voltage Drop**](Via%20Shunt): Every *load* consumes energy and causes a *voltage drop*: by inserting an *artificial load* (called **Shunt** resistor) with a *very precise known resistance* in series with the real *load*, the *current* can be measured via the *voltage drop*. The **Shunt** resistance must be *very low* in order to minimize energy loss through *heat*. For the same reasons, the *shunt* resistor must be capable of handling the *total current*. A *shunt* can measure *current* very precisely. It requires the insertion of a *shunt* resistance into the circuit, though, and the higher the currents are, the more strain is on the *shunt* resistor.
* **Hall Effect**: Every electrical current produces a magnetic field. In *AC* current, the magnetic field is alternating and can be measured using a cheap coil. With *DC*, the magnetic field is fixed but can still be measured using the *hall effect*. *Hall* sensors are more expensive than coils which is why *clamp meters* for *DC* are more expensive than those that can only measure *AC*. Coil and hall sensor are physically separated from the circuit and do not require insertion of a sensor. Even very high currents can be easily measured. There is no risk of thermal overload. However, magnetic fields generated in the proximity by other sources can influence the result.
