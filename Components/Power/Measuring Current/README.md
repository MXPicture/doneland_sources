# Measuring Voltage and Current

> Voltage Is Measured Directly. Current Is Measured Indirectly Via Voltage Generated By Voltage Drop or Magnetic Fields 

Both *voltage* and *current* are measured as *voltages*: an *Ampere-Meter* internally is a *Volt-Meter*, too.

## Measuring Voltage

The voltmeter is connected in parallel to the circuit or device whose voltage is to be measured: the positive terminal of the voltmeter is connected to the point in the circuit where you want to measure voltage, and the negative terminal is connected to the reference point (usually ground). 

Voltmeters have a *high internal resistance*. This is necessary because essentially, with a Voltmeter you are *short-circuiting* your circuit. Due to the high internal resistance, nothing bad happens, and only a very small current flows.

### Analog Voltmeters

Classic analog voltmeters use a coil or iron part that responds to the *magnetic field* produced by the electrical current. The amount of deflection of the pointer is proportional to the current flowing through the coil, which, in turn, is proportional to the voltage being measured. Since the *internal resistance* of the voltmeter is known, the amount of *current* flowing through it is directly proportional to the *voltage*:

* **5V:** When the voltmeter is connected to **5V** and has a known internal resistance of *500 Ohm*, according to *Ohms law* the *current* then is *U / R = I*, thus *5V/500Ohm = 10mA*. The current of *10mA* produces a magnetic field of 4x10-8 Tesla which moves the indicator of the analog voltmeter.
* **10V:** When the voltmeter is connected to **10V** and continues to have a known internal resistance of *500 Ohm*, according to *Ohms law* the *current* now is *U / R = I*, thus *10V/500Ohm = 20mA*. The current of *20mA* produces a magnetic field of *double the strength*: 8x10-8 Tesla which moves the indicator of the analog voltmeter *twice* as much.

Essentially, an analog voltmeter is using the magnetic field produced by a *current* to show the *voltage*. This is possible because the internal *resistance* of the voltmeter is known and *fixed*.

### Digital Voltmeters

Today, *digital* voltmeters are more common. They add an **ADC** (Analog-Digital-Converter) to convert analog voltage to a digital signal that is then displayed.

## Measuring Current

The example of the *analog voltmeter* has already illustrated that there is a close relationship between *current* and *voltage*. 

Both *together* move electrons and produce various physical effects that can be measured. The principle of measuring *current* and *voltage* is the same: you look at appropriate physical effects that can be correlated to the flow of *current* or *voltage*. When some parts of the *Ohms law* formula are *known* or *fixed*, you can calculate the other parts.

There are *two* physical effects proportional to the flow of *current*:

* [**Voltage Drop**](Via%20Shunt): Every *load* consumes energy and causes a *voltage drop*: by inserting an *artificial load* (called **Shunt** resistor) with a *very precise known resistance* in series with the real *load*, the *current* can be measured via the *voltage drop*. The **Shunt** resistance must be *very low* in order to minimize energy loss through *heat*. For the same reasons, the *shunt* resistor must be capable of handling the *total current*. A *shunt* can measure *current* very precisely. It requires the insertion of a *shunt* resistance into the circuit, though, and the higher the currents are, the more strain is on the *shunt* resistor.
* **Hall Effect**: Every electrical current produces a magnetic field. In *AC* current, the magnetic field is alternating and can be measured using a cheap coil. With *DC*, the magnetic field is fixed but can still be measured using the *hall effect*. *Hall* sensors are more expensive than coils which is why *clamp meters* for *DC* are more expensive than those that can only measure *AC*. Coil and hall sensor are physically separated from the circuit and do not require insertion of a sensor. Even very high currents can be easily measured. There is no risk of thermal overload. However, magnetic fields generated in the proximity by other sources can influence the result.
