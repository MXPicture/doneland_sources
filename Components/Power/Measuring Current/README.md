# Measuring Current

> Current Is Measured Indirectly: Voltage Drop or Magnetic Fields Are Used To Calculate Current

There are *two* physical effects caused by *current*. These effects are *proportional* to the amount of current which is why they are commonly used to measure *current*:

* [**Voltage Drop**](Via%20Shunt): Every *load* consumes energy and causes a proportional *voltage drop* that can be measured to determine the *current* indirectly: by inserting an *artificial load* (**Shunt** resistor) in series with the real *load*, the *current* can be measured via the *voltage drop* at the known **Shunt** resistance. The **Shunt** needs to have a *very precisely known* resistance, and its resistance must be *very low* in order to minimize energy loss through *heat*. For the same reasons, the *shunt* resistor must be capable of handling the *total current*. Since a *shunt* is connected *in series* with the load, the total current passes through the *shunt* resistor.
* **Hall Effect**: Every electrical current produces a magnetic field. In *AC* current, the magnetic field is alternating and can be measured using a coil. With *DC*, the magnetic field is fixed and can be measured using the *hall effect*. Since coil and hall sensor are physically separated from the *load circuit*, even very high currents can be measured. There is no risk of thermal overload. Magnetic fields generated in the proximity by other sources can influence the result, though.
