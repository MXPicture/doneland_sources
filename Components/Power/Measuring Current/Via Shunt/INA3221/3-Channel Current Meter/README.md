# 3-Channel Current Meter

> Implementing a 3-Channel Current Meter With INA3221

This section illustrates various approaches to using the [INA3221](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina3221.pdf?ts=1720423291346) to create a 3-channel current (and voltage) meter.

## Overview

A *current and voltage meter* is a valuable tool for any lab. It clearly shows the current consumption of devices, and by summing up consumed currents, you can determine the total energy consumption in *Ah* or *Wh*. 

This is particularly useful for testing battery capacities or examining charge and discharge curves.

### Multi-Channel Measurements

The *INA3221* provides three independent channels, allowing measurement of three separate loads. However, **all loads must share a common ground**. 

Multi-channel measurements have many practical applications. For example, a typical solar panel setup can benefit from all three channels:

* **Channel #1: Solar Panel**  
  Measures the raw power input from the solar cell.

* **Channel #2: Solar Controller Output**  
  Measures the power output from the solar controller. By comparing this data with *Channel #1*, you can calculate the **solar controller efficiency**.

* **Channel #3: Charger**  
  Measures the power output used to charge the buffer battery.

### Limitations

The *INA3221* is an affordable chip for current and voltage measurement but comes with some limitations, especially when using commonly available breakout boards:

* **High-Side Measurement**  
  The *INA3221* only supports high-side measurements. This means all channels must share the same ground. While this is a design constraint for your schematics, it typically doesn't affect field usage.

* **Maximum Current**  
  Most breakout boards include a *0.01 Ohm* shunt resistor. This limits the maximum measurable current to *1.638A*. To measure higher currents, you would need to *lower* the shunt resistor value. For instance:  
    - Adding another *R100* (*0.01 Ohm*) resistor in parallel with the existing one reduces the effective resistance to *0.005 Ohms*, doubling the maximum measurable current to *3.276A*.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While reducing the shunt resistor value allows for measuring higher currents, **the PCB traces on typical breakout boards are not designed to handle high currents**. In such cases, desolder the built-in shunt resistor and replace it with a properly rated external shunt resistor designed for higher currents.
## Implementations

Using the [INA3221](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina3221.pdf) requires a [microcontroller](https://done.land/components/microcontroller/) because it communicates via a digital [I2C](https://done.land/fundamentals/interface/i2c/) interface. If you need to develop a device without a microcontroller, consider the analog **INA169** as an alternative (one channel only, so you would need three of these).

For the examples in this section, Iâ€™ll use the [ESP32-C3 SuperMini](https://done.land/components/microcontroller/families/esp/esp32/developmentboards/esp32-c3/c3supermini/) due to its compact size, good availability, and affordability. However, you can use any microcontroller that meets your project's requirements.

The actual firmware for the device can be developed in a few different ways:

### C++ Libraries

For maximum flexibility and control, you can use one of the many *INA3221 libraries* available for C++. This approach gives you fine-grained control over the functionality, but it also requires more effort:  

- You'll need to handle all the programming work yourself.  
- Additional libraries may be needed if you want to include features like a display interface or a web server.

This option is ideal for advanced users who want complete customization of their implementation.

### ESPHome

A simpler and more accessible approach is to use [ESPHome](https://done.land/tools/software/esphome/introduction/). The ESPHome ecosystem provides native support for the *INA3221*, so no programming skills are required. ESPHome also manages features like:

- **WiFi support**  
- **OTA (over-the-air updates)**  

As an additional benefit, integrating your device with [Home Assistant](https://done.land/tools/software/homeassistant/) becomes seamless. This allows for automatic logging of measured values and enables triggering automations based on those readings.
