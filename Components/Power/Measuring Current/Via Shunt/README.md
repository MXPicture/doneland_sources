# Measuring Current Via Shunt

> When You Connect a Known Resistor In Series With a Load, the Voltage Drop is Proportional to the Current.

Measurement must not influence the load: the inserted resistor must have a *very low* resistence in the range of only a few *milliohm*. Such resistors are called **Shunt**.

When you add a **Shunt** to your circuit, all of the current passes the low-resistance *shunt*. 

The *current* flowing is equal to the *voltage drop* across the **Shunt** divided by the resistance of the *shunt*. The result is typicall a *very low voltage* that can be measured. Since the voltage drop is in the range of only a few *milliamperes*, special amplifier circuits are used. A regular *multimeter* would not be able to measure the minimal voltage drop across a *shunt* with the necessary precision.

## Selecting a Shunt

The most important spec for a *shunt* is the maximum *current* it is supposed to measure. Depending on maximum current, a *shunt* can be a tiny **SMD** resistor or a huge external stripe of metal. For large currents, you can even build your own *shunt* from a piece of wire.

*Shunts* are typically designed to drop *50mV*, *75mV*, or *100mV* when operating at their maximum rated current.
