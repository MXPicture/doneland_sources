# Measuring Current Via Shunt

> When You Connect a Known Resistor In Series With a Load, the Voltage Drop is Proportional to the Current.

Obviously, such measurement should not influence the circuitry: the inserted resistor must have a *very low* resistence in the range of only a few *milliohm*. Such resistors are called **Shunt**.

When you add a **Shunt** to your circuit, almost all of the current passes the low-resistance **Shunt** directly. Only a tiny fraction is used by the *voltmeter* to measure the voltage drop at the **Shunt**. 

The *current* flowing is equal to the *voltage drop* across the **Shunt** divided by the resistance of the **Shunt**.

## Selecting a Shunt

The most important spec for a **Shunt** is the maximum *current* it is supposed to measure. Depending on maximum current, a **Shunt** can be a tiny **SMD** resistor or a huge external stripe of metal. 

Most **Shunts** are designed to drop *50mV*, *75mV*, or *100mV* when operating at their maximum rated current.
