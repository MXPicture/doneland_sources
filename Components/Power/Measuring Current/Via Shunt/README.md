# Measuring Current Via Shunt
:stopwatch: Reading time: 10 minutes.

## Quick overview
When you connect a known *resistor* in series with a load, then the *voltage drop* at this resistor is proportional to the *current*.

Obviously, the measurement should not influence the circuitry: the inserted resistor must have a *very low* value in the range of only a few *milliohm*. Such resistors are called **Shunt**.
