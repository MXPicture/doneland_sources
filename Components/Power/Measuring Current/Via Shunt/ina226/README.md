# INA226 Current And Voltage Monitoring
:stopwatch: Reading time: 10 minutes.

## Quick overview
**INA226** is a microchip from *Texas Instruments* that can measure *current* and *voltage* and calculate *power* from it. It is often used to *monitor* power consumption or the yield from *solar generators*.

**INA226** is available as *ready-to-go* breakout board with an integrated **Shunt** and should cost less than â‚¬2/piece.

**INA226** internally uses a 16-bit *ADC* (Analog-To-Digital converter) to measure *voltage*. It uses the **Shunt** principle to measure *current* via measuring the *voltage drop* at a **Shunt** resistor.

The maximum measured *voltage* is *36V*. The maximum measured *current* depends on the value of the **Shunt**.

Because of its high-resolution 16-bit *ADC* and automatic internal *averaging* of multiple samples, it produces very accurate and reliable readings. All of its measured and calculated values can be read by a microcontroller via *I2C*.

### Shunt Value and Maximum Current

**INA226** does not measure *current* directly. Instead, it measures the *voltage drop* at a **Shunt** resistor. The resistance of the **Shunt** determines the maximum *current* that you can measure.

#### Integrated Shunts

When using breakout boards, the most common presoldered **Shunt** is *R100* (0.1 Ohm). In theory, this enables the breakout board to measure a maximum *current* of *0.8A*. 

Less often you find boards with a *R010* **Shunt** (0.01 Ohm) which increases the maximum *current* to *8A* at the expense of precision. Boards with a *R002* **Shunt** can measure up to *20A*.

The *real* maximum current that you can measure with this type of breakout board depends on two factors:

* **Overall resistance**: In addition to the resistance of the soldered **Shunt**, there can be more resistances adding up. Cheap breakout boards use PCBs that add additional resistance in their paths. Likely, the overall resistance is *higher* than expected.
* **Conductance**: A small PCB cannot conduct high currents. Since the **Shunt** is connected *in series* with the load, the *full total currency* is flowing through it. The practical maximum current - regardless of **Shunt** - is most likely limited to *5-8A*, depending on PCB quality.

Always test and measure breakout boards with integrated **Shunts** yourself and individually board-by-board to find out their true maximum *current*.

> [!TIP]
> Should the breakout board max out even on low currents (indicating that the **Shunt** resistance is too high), you can try and short circuit the integrated **Shunt** resistor. Often, the low-quality internal resistance of the *PCB* all by itself is acting well enough as a **Shunt**.
>
> If you need to measure larger *currents*, consider removing the presoldered **Shunt** and connecting an external **Shunt** rated for higher currents.
