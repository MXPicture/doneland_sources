# DC Power Supplies 

> Stable And Regulated DC Power For Lab And Projects

A DC power supply is an electronic device that provides a stable and regulated direct current (DC) voltage. It converts input power to a DC voltage suitable for labs, projects, and electronic devices.

## Overview
When power is generated—by industrial power plants, batteries, solar panels, etc.—it may fluctuate in voltage. If the power is generated by turbines, the power is also AC. Most devices, however, require a stable DC voltage.

*Power supplies* are electronic components that take a wide range of input voltages and convert them to a stable DC output voltage. They may convert *AC* to *DC* if they support AC input, such as when plugged into a household outlet.

## Constant Voltage
The primary function of every power supply is to provide a *Constant Voltage* (*CV*) at the output. Here are some common examples of *CV power supplies*:

* **AC-DC Converter**: These take a fixed *AC* input voltage, and typically use a transformer to lower the voltage to a fixed intermediate voltage. A *rectifier* then converts *AC* to *DC*. The intermediate DC is stabilized using discrete components, or further processed by a *DC-DC converter*.
    * **Examples**: Laptop chargers, USB power supplies, lab bench power supplies, etc. (that take power from *AC mains*)
* **DC-DC Converter**: Often called *switching power supplies* due to their internal switching circuits, these require a *DC* input. A switching power supply can dynamically *lower*, *raise*, or *both* raise and lower the input voltage in a very efficient manner.

   Typically, *DC-DC converters* are used inside devices (including some *AC-DC converters*) to ensure the device receives the appropriate voltage and to make devices compatible with a wide range of input voltages.

### Voltage Regulators
A *DC-DC converter* typically uses *switching technology* (i.e. *Buck* to lower and *Boost* to raise the voltage). *Switching technology* is highly efficient, especially at higher loads, but also more complex.

For *lower loads*, *linear voltage regulators* can be used. These are essentially variable resistors that automatically adjust their resistance to produce a stable output voltage using the simple *voltage divider paradigm*. 

Linear voltage regulators can only *lower* a voltage, and excess energy is converted to heat and wasted. The greater the input and output voltage difference, the less efficient they become. However, they are very affordable and do not produce artifacts like *voltage ripple*, which is why they are typically used for microcontroller development boards and other microelectronics that consume only a few hundred *mA*.

The same basic principle is used with *current-limiting* resistors, such as when powering small *LEDs*. These are even less precise, as they cannot compensate for load fluctuations. For low-current indicator LEDs, they work fine. However, as the current demand increases (e.g., with high-power LEDs or LED strips), *switching power supplies* are used instead.

## Constant Current
More sophisticated power supplies add *Constant Current (CC)* capabilities to their basic *constant voltage* capabilities. These are called *Constant Voltage Constant Current (CV CC)* power supplies. Being able to limit the maximum current is essential in many scenarios:

* **Sensitive Devices**: Some devices, like *LEDs*, have very low internal resistance. When they receive a current that exceeds their limits, they can be damaged.
* **Chargers**: Similar to *LEDs*, *rechargeable batteries* also have very low internal resistance. To charge them, the current must be limited.
* **Safety**: In lab environments, a current limit can be a safety measure to ensure that currents do not exceed safe levels, even if the power supply is connected to faulty circuits.

<details><summary>How does CV CC really work?</summary><br/>

When you add *constant current* to *constant voltage*, things become a bit more complex. The terms become less accurate, and it might be better to think of them as *maximum voltage* and *maximum current*.

When you set a *constant current* in a *CV CC* power supply, the current is not necessarily constant. If the device requires less current, then less current flows. The power supply does not force the current up to keep it "constant," nor would that make any sense.

Likewise, a *CV CC* power supply does not necessarily maintain a *constant voltage* either. When the current exceeds the threshold, the power supply *lowers* the voltage to whatever is necessary to keep the current constant.

To better understand *CV CC*, consider these two scenarios:

* **Device takes less than CC current**: The *voltage is constant*, and the current is whatever the device draws (this is often called *CV* mode).
* **Device takes more than CC current (or would like to)**: The *current is constant*, and the voltage is lowered as needed to decrease the current flow (this is called *CC* mode).

A *CV CC* power supply operates in *CV* mode until the current exceeds its limit. At that point, it switches to *CC* mode.

This also answers the question, "Are there *CC only* power supplies?" A *CC-only* power supply would be a *CV CC* power supply with a *Buck* (step-down) behavior where the *CV* is set to the input voltage.

## Transformers vs. Switching Power Supplies
A few decades ago, power supplies were typically large, heavy, and expensive. This was due to the use of *large transformers* to transform the input voltage to a different level.

### Transformers

Transformers are still used today because they have distinct advantages:

* **Scalable**: Transformers can be designed to handle any required amount of energy.
* **Linear**: The output voltage waveform is not altered, so there are no noise or artifacts introduced by the voltage transformation. This is beneficial for use cases like *HiFi*, *radio amateurs*, and similar applications, where signal quality is a priority.

However, their disadvantages often outweigh the advantages, especially when signal quality is not a top priority:

* **Heavy**: Transformers require iron parts and many coil windings. The size and weight of the transformer increase with the amount of power required. Transformers for low loads may be small and inexpensive, but as power demands rise, transformers become larger and heavier.
* **Expensive**: Due to the materials required for transformers, they can be expensive.
* **AC Only**: Transformers rely on electromagnetic effects and only work with *AC* input. Most devices, however, require *DC*.

### Switching Power Supply

With the advent of *MOSFET* transistors, fast *switching* became possible, enabling *Buck* and *Boost* converter circuits. As a result, *switching power supplies* have become lightweight, small, and affordable.

In *AC adapters*, a small transformer (or sometimes just a rectifier) is used to produce raw DC voltage, which is then processed by the switching power supply to create the desired output voltage.

> [!NOTE]
> While it is possible to send rectified AC directly to a transformerless switching power supply, this requires efficient filtering to handle high voltage spikes. It is often more practical to still use a transformer to lower the incoming voltage. However, switching power supplies allow the transformer to be much smaller and more affordable. This is because switching power supplies operate at very high frequencies, typically above *100kHz*, compared to traditional transformers that operate at *50-60Hz*. At *100kHz*, the transformer can process *2,000 cycles of energy* in the same time a traditional *50Hz* transformer handles just one cycle, drastically reducing the size and material needed for the transformer.


#### Fast Switching

Switching power supplies do not require iron parts and are made with a few affordable electronic components:

* **Buck**: An inductor is placed **in the output path** and stores some of the energy (reducing the voltage). A fast-switching MOSFET interrupts the input power to allow the inductor to release the stored energy. As a result, the output voltage **decreases**.
* **Boost**: The inductor is placed **outside the output path** and stores additional energy without affecting the output. A fast-switching MOSFET interrupts the input power to the inductor and adds energy to the output. The **voltage increases**.

#### Ripple and Artifacts

Switching power supplies typically operate at frequencies ranging from *100 kHz* to *20 MHz*. Due to these high frequencies, the output voltage appears stable to the devices connected to it.

However, when viewed on an oscilloscope, the output from switching power supplies may show *voltage ripple*. The amount of ripple depends on the switching frequency (lesser with higher frequency) and the overall quality of the power supply. High-quality switching power supplies can have ripple as low as *<5mV*, while cheaper DC-DC regulators might produce ripple of *>100mV* or more. Excessive ripple can interfere with sensitive devices, leading to malfunctions.

Generally, the *switching frequency* of a DC-DC converter is an indicator for its quality:


| Frequency Range          | Typical Applications                                         | Advantages                        | Disadvantages                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **20 kHz to 50 kHz**     | Older designs, low-cost devices                             | Easier to design and produce      | Larger inductors and capacitors   |
| **100 kHz to 500 kHz**   | Consumer electronics, general-purpose devices               | Good balance of size and cost     | Moderate design complexity        |
| **500 kHz to several MHz** | High-performance industrial equipment, compact chargers   | Smaller components, higher efficiency | Higher design complexity, increased EMI |
| **20 MHz and above**     | RF-based power conversion, ultra-compact designs            | Extremely small components        | Very high switching losses, difficult EMI management |


A higher switching frequency lowers the requirements for external components: since less energy needs to be stored per cycle, higher-frequency DC-DC converters can be either *smaller* or *more efficient*.

> [!TIP]
> One disadvantage of higher frequencies is *EMI* (*Electromagnetic Interference*). At high frequencies, a carefully engineered design is essential, or the circuit may emit radio waves that can cause interference and potentially violate legal regulations. For DIY projects with limited EMI diagnostic tools, it is advisable to use DC-DC converters operating in the *100-500 kHz* range. For higher frequencies, consider using ready-made breakout boards from trusted sources with proper EMI shielding.


## Conclusion

While traditional transformers are still useful in specific applications requiring linear voltage conversion and high signal integrity, *switching power supplies* have largely replaced them for most modern power supply applications. 

For *DC input*, voltage regulators can dynamically transform a variable input voltage to a stable output voltage using *Buck*, *Boost*, or *Buck-Boost* technology, depending on the requirements.
