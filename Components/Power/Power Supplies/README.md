# DC Power Supplies 

> Stable And Regulated DC Power For Lab And Projects

A DC power supply is an electronic device that provides a stable and regulated direct current (DC) voltage. It converts input power to a DC voltage suitable for labs, projects, and electric devices.


## Overview
When power is generated - by industrial power plants, batteries, solar panels, etc. - it has a given *voltage* that might be fluctuating. If the power is generated by *turbines*, the power is also *AC*. Most devices require a *stable DC voltage*.

*Power supplies* are electronic components that take a wide range of input voltages, and convert them to a stable DC output voltage. They may convert *AC* to *DC* if they support AC input, i.e. when they can be plugged into a household outlet.

## Constant Voltage
The fundamental job of *every* power supply is to provide a *Constant Voltage* (*CV*) at the output. Here are typical examples of *CV power supplies*:

* **AC-DC converter:** take a fixed *AC* input voltage and use a transformer to lower the voltage to a fixed intermediate voltage. Then a *rectifier* is used to convert *AC* to *DC*. This *DC* can then be stabilized using discrete components, or the intermediate DC is next further processed by a *DC-DC converter*.
    * **Examples:** Laptop chargers, USB power supplies, Lab Bench Power Supplies, etc. (that take power from *AC mains*)
* **DC-DC converter:** these are often called *switching power supply* due to the way how these circuits internally work, and they require *DC* input. A switching power supply can dynamically *lower*, *raise*, or *lower and raise* the input voltage in a very efficient manner. 

   Typically, *DC-DC converters* are used inside of devices (including some *AC-DC converters*) to ensure that the device receives the appropriate voltage, and to make devices compatible with a range of input voltages.


### Voltage Regulators
A *DC-DC converter* typically uses *switching technology* (i.e. *Buck* to lower and *Boost* to raise the voltage). *Switching technology* is highly efficient, especially at higher loads, but also more complex.

For *lower loads*, *linear voltage regulators* can be used: these are essentially variable resistors that adjust their resistance automatically to produce a stable output voltage, utilizing the simple *voltage divider paradigm*. 

Linear voltage regulators can only *lower* a voltage, and excess energy is converted to heat and wasted. The greater the input and output voltage difference is, the less efficient they are. However, they are very affordable and do not produce artefacts like *voltage ripple* which is why they are typically used for microcontroller development boards and other microelectronic that consumes only a few hundred *mA*.

The same basic principle is used with *current-limiting* resistors, i.e. when powering small *LEDs*. They are even less precise as they cannot compensate load fluctuations. For low-current indicator LEDs, they work fine. As soon as the current demand rises, i.e. with high-power LEDs or LED strips, *switching power supplies* are used.


## Constant Current
More sophisticated power supplies add *Constant Current (CC)* capabilities to their basic *constant voltage* capabilities: they are called *Constant Voltage Constant Current (CV CC)*. Being able to limit the maximum current can be required in many scenarios:

* **Sensitive Devices:** some devices like *LED* have a very low internal resistance. When they receive a current that exceeds their limits, they are damaged.
* **Chargers:** similar to *LEDs*, *rechargeable batteries*, too, have a very low internal resistance. To charge them, the current needs to be limited.
* **Safety:** when power supplies are used in lab environments, a current limit can be a safety measure to ensure that currents cannot rise to dangerous levels, even if the power supply is connected to faulty circuits.


<details><summary>How does CV CC really work?</summary><br/>

When you add *constant current* to *constant voltage*, things become confusing because now the terms aren't correct anymore. They would better be called *maximum voltage maximum current*.

When you set a *constant current* in a *CV CC* power supply, the current is not necessarily constant: if the device requires less current, then less current flows. The power supply has no way of *forcing* the current up to keep it "constant", nor would that make any sense.

Likewise, a *CV CC* power supply does not necessarily maintain a *constant voltage*, either: when the current exceeds the threshold, the power supply *lowers* the voltage to whatever is necessary to keep the current constant.

To better understand *CV CC*, consider these two scenarios:

* **Device takes less than CC current:** the *voltage is constant*, the current is whatever the device draws (often called *CV* mode)
* **Device takes more than CC current (or at least would like to):** the *current is constant*, and this is achieved by *lowering the voltage* as much as needed to actively decrease the flow of current (often called *CC* mode)

A *CV CC* power supply operates in *CV* mode until the current exceeds its limit, in which case the power supply operates in *CC* mode.

This also answers the question: "are there *CC only* power supplies?". A *CC only* power supply would be a *CV CC* power supply with a *Buck* (Step-Down) behavior where the *CV* is set to the input voltage.

## Transformers vs. Switching Power Supplies
A few decades ago, power supplies were generally big, heavy, and expensive. That's because at this time, *large transformers* were used to transform the input voltage to a different voltage.

### Transformers

Transformers are still in use because they have some distinct advantages:

* **Scalable:** if you design the transformer appropriately, it can transform any required amount of energy.
* **Linear:** the output voltage wave form is not changed, so there is no noise or artefacts introduced by the voltage transformation. For use cases like *HiFi*,  *radio amateurs*, and similar, this may significantly improve signal quality.

Their disadvantages outweigh their advantages though, especially when signal quality is not a top priority:

* **Heavy:** transformers require iron parts and many coil windings, and the investment in these materials is proportional to the intended power. Transformers for low loads may be cheap and small, however once you require more than just a few hundred *mA*, transformers become heavy and big.
* **Expensive:** Due to the materials they require, they are very expensive parts.
* **AC Only:** since transformers rely on electromagnetic effects, they only work with *AC*. Most devices require *DC*, though.

### Switching Power Supply

With the advent of *MosFET* transistors, fast *switching* became possible, and this led to *Buck* and *Boost* converter circuits. Because of the *switching technology* they use, both are called *switching power supplies*. 

Thanks to *switching power supplies*, they now can be lightweight, small, and very affordable. If used for *AC adapters*, a much smaller transformer - or in some cases a recifier is used directly - to produce a raw DC voltage which then gets processed by the switchting power supply to create the desired output voltage.


#### Fast Switching

Switching power supplies do not need iron parts and just a few very affordable electronic components:

* **Buck:** an inductor is **inserted into** the output path and steals some of the energy (reduces voltage). A fast-switching MosFET regularly interrupts the input power supply to cause the inductor to return the stolen energy. As a result, the output voltage **is lowered**.
* **Boost:** the inductor is placed **outside** the output path and stores *additional* energy without taking energy from the *output*. A fast-switching MosFET regularly interrupts the input power to the inductor, and it *adds* its energy to the output. The **voltage rises**.

#### Ripple And Artifacts

Typical switching power supplies switch at frequency in the range of *100kHz* to *20MHz*. Due to this high frequency, the output voltage appears *stable* to the output devices.

However, when examined with an oscilloscope, the output coming from *switching power supplies* is to some extent distorted, typically showing a *voltage ripple*. The amount of ripple depends on the switching frequency and the overall circuit quality of the power supply. With good switching power supplies, ripple is hardly noticeable in the range of *<5mV*. Cheap DC-DC regulators can emit significant ripple *>100mV* or more. When the ripple becomes too strong, it can start to interfere with the devices you are powering, potentially causing malfunctions.






However, for general power supplies, they have largely been replaced by *switching power supplies*

When a power supply receives *AC* input power and uses a *transformer* to reduce the input voltage, then the resulting voltage is fixed and depends on the design of the transformer and the number of coil windings. That's ok because typical *AC input* has a fixed voltage.

With *DC* input, the voltage may not be fixed and vary greatly. For example, solar cells can produce voltages across a high range. Likewise, battery voltage drops considerably while the battery is being discharged.

For DC input, *voltage regulators* can dynamically transform a variable input voltage to a stable output voltage:

* **Buck:** *lowers* a DC input voltage *(step-down)*
* **Boost:** *Raises* a DC input voltage *(step-up)*
* **Buck-Boost:** *lowers* or *raises* DC input voltage as needed *(step-up-down)*

Both can be combined if necessary. For example, to power a portable *3.3V microcontroller* from a single *Li-Ion battery cell*, the power supply must deal with an input voltage range of *2.8V-4.2V*, and the required output voltage is within this range. In cases where the target voltage is within the range of the input voltage, a *Buck-Boost* voltage regulator is needed: it can *raise* or *lower* the input voltage as needed.

### Examples of Power Supplies

There is a wide range of devices sorted into the category *power supplies*:

* **AC-DC Adapter:** typical notebook chargers or USB power supplies that plug into *AC mains*
