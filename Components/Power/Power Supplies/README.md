# DC Power Supplies 

> Stable And Regulated DC Power For Lab And Projects

A DC power supply is an electronic device that provides a stable and regulated direct current (DC) voltage. It converts input power to a DC voltage suitable for labs, projects, and electronic devices.

## Overview
When power is generated—by industrial power plants, batteries, solar panels, etc.—it may fluctuate in voltage. If the power is generated by turbines, the power is also AC. Most devices, however, require a stable DC voltage.

*Power supplies* are electronic components that take a wide range of input voltages and convert them to a stable DC output voltage. They may convert *AC* to *DC* if they support AC input, such as when plugged into a household outlet.

## Constant Voltage
The primary function of every power supply is to provide a *Constant Voltage* (*CV*) at the output. Here are some common examples of *CV power supplies*:

* **AC-DC Converter**: These take a fixed *AC* input voltage, and typically use a transformer to lower the voltage to a fixed intermediate voltage. A *rectifier* then converts *AC* to *DC*. The intermediate DC is stabilized using discrete components, or further processed by a *DC-DC converter*.
    * **Examples**: Laptop chargers, USB power supplies, lab bench power supplies, etc. (that take power from *AC mains*)
* **DC-DC Converter**: Often called *switching power supplies* due to their internal switching circuits, these require a *DC* input. A switching power supply can dynamically *lower*, *raise*, or *both* raise and lower the input voltage in a very efficient manner.

   Typically, *DC-DC converters* are used inside devices (including some *AC-DC converters*) to ensure the device receives the appropriate voltage and to make devices compatible with a wide range of input voltages.




### Voltage Regulators
A *DC-DC converter* typically uses *switching technology* (i.e. *Buck* to lower and *Boost* to raise the voltage). *Switching technology* is highly efficient, especially at higher loads, but also more complex.


<img src="images/xl4015_buck_5a_top_angle_t.png" width="40%" height="40%" />


For *lower loads*, *linear voltage regulators* can be used. These are essentially variable resistors that automatically adjust their resistance to produce a stable output voltage using the simple *voltage divider paradigm*. 

Linear voltage regulators can only *lower* a voltage, and excess energy is converted to heat and wasted. The greater the input and output voltage difference, the less efficient they become. However, they are very affordable and do not produce artifacts like *voltage ripple*, which is why they are typically used for microcontroller development boards and other microelectronics that consume only a few hundred *mA*.


<img src="images/ldo_example.png" width="40%" height="40%" />


The same basic principle is used with *current-limiting* resistors, such as when powering small *LEDs*. These are even less precise, as they cannot compensate for load fluctuations. For low-current indicator LEDs, they work fine. However, as the current demand increases (e.g., with high-power LEDs or LED strips), *switching power supplies* are used instead.

## Constant Current
More sophisticated power supplies add *Constant Current (CC)* capabilities to their basic *constant voltage* capabilities. These are called *Constant Voltage Constant Current (CV CC)* power supplies. Being able to limit the maximum current is essential in many scenarios:

* **Sensitive Devices**: Some devices, like *LEDs*, have very low internal resistance. When they receive a current that exceeds their limits, they can be damaged.
* **Chargers**: Similar to *LEDs*, *rechargeable batteries* also have very low internal resistance. To charge them, the current must be limited.
* **Safety**: In lab environments, a current limit can be a safety measure to ensure that currents do not exceed safe levels, even if the power supply is connected to faulty circuits.

<details><summary>How does CV CC really work?</summary><br/>

When you add *constant current* to *constant voltage*, things become a bit more complex. The terms become less accurate, and it might be better to think of them as *maximum voltage* and *maximum current*.

When you set a *constant current* in a *CV CC* power supply, the current is not necessarily constant. If the device requires less current, then less current flows. The power supply does not force the current up to keep it "constant," nor would that make any sense.

Likewise, a *CV CC* power supply does not necessarily maintain a *constant voltage* either. When the current exceeds the threshold, the power supply *lowers* the voltage to whatever is necessary to keep the current constant.

To better understand *CV CC*, consider these two scenarios:

* **Device takes less than CC current**: The *voltage is constant*, and the current is whatever the device draws (this is often called *CV* mode).
* **Device takes more than CC current (or would like to)**: The *current is constant*, and the voltage is lowered as needed to decrease the current flow (this is called *CC* mode).

A *CV CC* power supply operates in *CV* mode until the current exceeds its limit. At that point, it switches to *CC* mode.

This also answers the question, "Are there *CC only* power supplies?" A *CC-only* power supply would be a *CV CC* power supply with a *Buck* (step-down) behavior where the *CV* is set to the input voltage.

## Transformers vs. Switching Power Supplies
A few decades ago, power supplies were typically large, heavy, and expensive. This was due to the use of *large transformers* to transform the input voltage to a different level.

### Transformers

Transformers are still used today because they have distinct advantages:


<img src="images/transformer_big_t.png" width="40%" height="40%" />


* **Scalable**: Transformers can be designed to handle any required amount of energy.
* **Linear**: The output voltage waveform is not altered, so there are no noise or artifacts introduced by the voltage transformation. This is beneficial for use cases like *HiFi*, *radio amateurs*, and similar applications, where signal quality is a priority.

However, their disadvantages often outweigh the advantages, especially when signal quality is not a top priority:

* **Heavy**: Transformers require iron parts and many coil windings. The size and weight of the transformer increase with the amount of power required. Transformers for low loads may be small and inexpensive, but as power demands rise, transformers become larger and heavier.
* **Expensive**: Due to the materials required for transformers, they can be expensive.
* **AC Only**: Transformers rely on electromagnetic effects and only work with *AC* input. Most devices, however, require *DC*.

### Switching Power Supply

With the advent of *MOSFET* transistors, fast *switching* became possible, enabling *Buck* and *Boost* converter circuits. 


<img src="images/mosfet_overview_t.png" width="30%" height="30%" />


As a result, *switching power supplies* have become lightweight, small, and affordable.


<img src="images/transformer_small_t.png" width="25%" height="25%" />


In *AC adapters*, a small transformer (or sometimes just a rectifier) is used to produce raw DC voltage, which is then processed by the switching power supply to create the desired output voltage.

> [!NOTE]
> While it is possible to send rectified AC directly to a transformerless switching power supply, this requires efficient filtering to handle high voltage spikes. It is often more practical to still use a transformer to lower the incoming voltage. However, switching power supplies allow the transformer to be much smaller and more affordable. This is because switching power supplies operate at very high frequencies, typically above *100kHz*, compared to traditional transformers that operate at *50-60Hz*. At *100kHz*, the transformer can process *2,000 cycles of energy* in the same time a traditional *50Hz* transformer handles just one cycle, drastically reducing the size and material needed for the transformer.


#### Fast Switching

Switching power supplies do not require iron parts and are made with a few affordable electronic components:

* **Buck**: An inductor is placed **in the output path** and stores some of the energy (reducing the voltage). A fast-switching MOSFET interrupts the input power to allow the inductor to release the stored energy. As a result, the output voltage **decreases**.
* **Boost**: The inductor is placed **outside the output path** and stores additional energy without affecting the output. A fast-switching MOSFET interrupts the input power to the inductor and adds energy to the output. The **voltage increases**.

#### Ripple and Artifacts

Switching power supplies typically operate at frequencies ranging from *100 kHz* to *20 MHz*. Due to these high frequencies, the output voltage appears stable to the devices connected to it.

However, when viewed on an oscilloscope, the output from switching power supplies may show *voltage ripple*. The amount of ripple depends on the switching frequency (lesser with higher frequency) and the overall quality of the power supply. High-quality switching power supplies can have ripple as low as *<5mV*, while cheaper DC-DC regulators might produce ripple of *>100mV* or more. Excessive ripple can interfere with sensitive devices, leading to malfunctions.

Generally, the *switching frequency* of a DC-DC converter is an indicator for its quality:


| Frequency Range          | Typical Applications                                         | Advantages                        | Disadvantages                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **20 kHz to 50 kHz**     | Older designs, low-cost devices                             | Easier to design and produce      | Larger inductors and capacitors   |
| **100 kHz to 500 kHz**   | Consumer electronics, general-purpose devices               | Good balance of size and cost     | Moderate design complexity        |
| **500 kHz to several MHz** | High-performance industrial equipment, compact chargers   | Smaller components, higher efficiency | Higher design complexity, increased EMI |
| **20 MHz and above**     | RF-based power conversion, ultra-compact designs            | Extremely small components        | Very high switching losses, difficult EMI management |


A higher switching frequency lowers the requirements for external components: since less energy needs to be stored per cycle, higher-frequency DC-DC converters can be either *smaller* or *more efficient*.


<details>
<summary>Should I Care About Switching Frequency?</summary><br/>

In hobby projects, you typically do not care much about the switching frequency of *DC-DC Converters*, and whether they are *fixed* or *variable*. What matters is that they are affordable and produce the desired voltages and currents.

However, it does pay off to look at switching frequencies after all because higher switching frequencies may enable you to *significantly* reduce the size, which may be especially important for portable devices where space is an issue.


### Typical Hobbyist Modules
Most cheap hobbyist *DC-DC Converters* are *fixed frequency PWM* converters.

*DC-DC Converters* with *fixed* frequency typically use the same **PWM** (pulse width modulation) that you may have used in your electronics projects to dim LEDs. Since the frequency is fixed and well above audible frequencies, converters will never emit annoying hissing sounds (*coil whine*). Their weak spot are *light loads*: due to the *fixed* frequency and **PWM**, the pulse width can only be shortened so much. With light loads, energy is lost and turned into heat, and efficiency decreases.

### Variable Switching Frequency
In *DC-DC Converters* with *variable* frequency, typically **PFM** (pulse frequency modulation) is used: the pulse width stays the same but the frequency of pulses changes. They are more efficient with light loads as the frequency can be easily lowered in a wide range. This can lead to a different problem: when the frequency is lowered so much that it enters audible ranges, these converters can produce an audible annoying high pitched hissing sound. This is also known as **Coil Whine** and can be produced by other parts of circuits as well when frequency drops into audible ranges.

### High Switching Frequency
Most *DC-DC converter* breakout boards targeting *hobbyists* use decades-old concepts and chip designs like the *XL4015* and similar. 


These are proven to work and can be produced with cheap components. The typical switching frequencies are below *500kHz*.

<img src="images/xl4015_buck_5a_top_angle_t.png" width="25%" height="25%" />

That's why the breakout boards are fairly large and require huge coils and electrolytic capacitors.

Modern *switching regulator technology* is using much higher frequencies, and better technology. Highly integrated chips like the *TPS61088* from *Texas Instruments* use a *1MHz* switching frequency and can work with much higher efficiency.

So the new generation of *DC-DC converter* boards is using such next-gen chips. As a result, the boards are much smaller while providing the same or even better performance. 

<img src="images/tps61088_overview_t.png" width="25%" height="25%" />

For example, the board depicted implements a *30W boost converter* that can raise a *2.7-10V* input voltage up to *12V*.

### EMI and Shielding
At high frequencies, a carefully engineered design is essential though, or the circuit may emit radio waves that can cause interference and potentially violate legal regulations. 
  
For DIY projects with limited EMI diagnostic tools and no space constraints, it makes sense to use DC-DC converters operating in the *100-500 kHz* range. For higher frequencies, use ready-made breakout boards from trusted sources with proper EMI shielding.

## Types of Power Supplies

[Switching power supplies](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/dc-dc-converters/) are used in a variety of everyday devices:

* **AC Adapter:** Uses the *AC mains* voltage as the primary source. It first converts *AC* to *DC* and then utilizes a transformer and/or a [switching power supply](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/dc-dc-converters/) to produce the required voltage for powering or charging devices.   
    * Small adapters for devices with low current requirements:

    <img src="images/powersupply_ac_brick4l_t.png" width="20%" height="20%" />

    * *power bricks* that can supply *60-120W* to devices with high power requirements (such as notebooks):

    <img src="images/powersupply_ac_brick1_t.png" width="40%" height="20%" />

    * modular switching power supplies ready to be mounted inside devices. Such modules exist for various power requirements in different sizes and voltages and are often found inside *PC*, as well as in other larger appliances:

    <img src="images/switching_powersupply_overview_case_t.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

    * *DIN rail*-mounted switching power supplies are a variant of the above and can easily be added to electrical household installations (i.e. to power sensors, microelectronics, etc.)

    <img src="images/powersupply_rail2_t.png" width="20%" height="20%" />



* **[Battery:](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/)** A rechargeable battery can act as a primary power source, such as in *power banks*, or when specifically powering portable devices.
  * **Power Bank:** A power bank incorporates *two* switching power supplies: one designed to [charge the battery](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/chargers/charge-discharge/) and the other to discharge it to power external devices.
  * **Charger:** Dedicated *chargers* are engineered to charge specific battery types. These chargers typically include a [DC-DC regulator](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/dc-dc-converters/) that provides *constant current* to safely charge the battery.
* **[Solar Chargers:](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/solar/)** These systems rely on *two* power sources. Solar panels provide a fluctuating DC input voltage, which the *solar charger* converts into a regulated charging current to charge a [battery](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/). The battery acts as a buffer, storing energy for later use. Since the battery voltage also fluctuates based on its *state of charge*, another [DC-DC regulator](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/dc-dc-converters/) stabilizes the output voltage as needed.
* **AC Converters:** These devices take a low DC voltage and produce a high AC voltage comparable to *AC mains*, allowing *AC mains* devices to operate on battery power, e.g., as a backup power supply. Internally, they consist of a [switching power supply](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/dc-dc-converters/) that steps up the low input voltage to the required high output voltage, combined with a *DC-AC converter* that turns DC into AC. This process is more complex than simple *AC-DC conversion*, which often involves a basic *rectifier*.
* **Lab Bench Power Supply:** A highly configurable power supply for hobbyists, engineers, and researchers, with advanced protections. It can provide a wide range of voltages with high precision and can limit current according to user requirements. This is ideal for experimental scenarios where power must adapt to changing needs, i.e. when trying to simulate a discharging battery at different voltages, or submitting power to various electronic components under test.     

    <img src="images/powersupply_xy_sk120x_display1_t.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

* [Electronic Load:](https://done.land/tools/devices/electronicload/) A device commonly used in lab environments to **simulate a load** by consuming a precise and configurable amount of energy. To achieve this, electronic loads incorporate components designed to **dissipate energy**, typically using a combination of **MOSFETs** with sophisticated heat sinks. Additionally, they include various **DC-DC regulator** circuits to ensure that the energy is consumed in a controlled manner, matching the specific requirements of a given test scenario.

## Conclusion

While traditional transformers (*linear power supplies*) are still useful in specific applications requiring linear voltage conversion and high signal integrity, *switching power supplies* have largely replaced them for most modern power supply applications. 

For *DC input*, voltage regulators can dynamically transform a variable input voltage to a stable output voltage using *Buck*, *Boost*, or *Buck-Boost* technology, depending on the requirements. Due to their high switching frequency, if there is a need for *AC-to-DC* conversion, they require much smaller and more affordable transformers.
