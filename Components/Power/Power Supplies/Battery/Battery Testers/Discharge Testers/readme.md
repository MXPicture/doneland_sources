# Discharge-Only Battery Testers

> Simple Battery Capacity Testers That Require Fully Charged Batteries Under Test

The fundamental principle of all battery testers is simple: draw energy from a fully charged battery until it is empty, and logging the total energy drawn. 

*Discharge only* testers cannot *charge* a battery. They rely on *you* to first charge the battery under test *before* you start testing. Compared with [all-in-one testers](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytesters/all-in-onetesters), they do come with  *voltage and current logging* and a *test load* but lack *charging capabilities*.

This has advantages and disadvantages:

* **No Automated Testing:** testing requires more work on your end as you need to manually charge batteries first with whatever charger you have at hand.
* **Low Power Requirements:** since *discharging* requires no external power, only the logging infrastructure (typically a microcontroller) needs to be supplied. In contrast, all-in-one battery testers may require hefty external power supplies, especially when they are able to test (and *charge*) four or more batteries simultaneously.
