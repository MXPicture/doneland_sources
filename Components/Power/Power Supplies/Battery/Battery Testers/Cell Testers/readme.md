# Cell Testers

> Testing Individual Battery Cells

[Battery packs with no internal BMS](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/unprotected/) expose each internal battery cell to the outside through a *balancer cable*.

In essence, such simplistic batteries delegate the responsibility of proper management to external devices. 

While you could use a simple voltmeter to test the overall battery voltage, this wouldn't be sufficient: since these batteries have no internal BMS that takes care of balancing the individual battery cells, you need a *cell tester* to determine battery health yourself.

A *cell tester* is essentially a voltmeter with multiple inputs. It connects to the battery's balancer cable and sequentially measures the individual voltages of all battery cells. This allows the tester to detect voltage irregularities and identify cells with deviating voltages that require balancing.

## Advantages of Using a Cell Tester

1. **Precise Monitoring:** Unlike a basic voltmeter, a cell tester provides detailed insights into the health of each individual cell, helping you pinpoint problems.
2. **Improved Battery Longevity:** Identifying and addressing imbalances early prevents overcharging or over-discharging of weaker cells, prolonging the overall battery life.
3. **Enhanced Safety:** Detecting failing cells minimizes risks of thermal runaway, swelling, or other hazardous conditions.

## Helpful Suggestions

1. **Regular Testing:** Conduct routine checks on batteries without a built-in BMS, especially before and after heavy usage.
2. **Threshold Awareness:** Know the acceptable voltage range for your specific battery chemistry. For instance:
   - Li-Ion cells typically range between 3.0V (discharged) and 4.2V (fully charged).
   - LiFePOâ‚„ cells usually range between 2.5V and 3.65V.
3. **Balancing Tools:** Combine your cell tester with a battery balancer or an active balancing device to address discrepancies between cell voltages.

## Types of Cell Testers

1. **Basic Multichannel Testers:** Allow manual sequential testing of cells but may lack automation.
2. **Integrated Monitors:** Include displays for real-time voltage readouts and may support data logging for trend analysis.
3. **Advanced Testers:** Provide automated balancing and integration with battery management systems for comprehensive management.

> [!TIP]
> When choosing a cell tester, ensure it supports the voltage range and number of cells in your battery pack to avoid compatibility issues.
