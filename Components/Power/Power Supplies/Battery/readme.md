# Batteries

> Portable Power Sources That Can Be Discardable Or Rechargeable

A battery cell stores energy chemically, and can supply this energy as electrical current. That's the common denominator of all battery cells. From here, it can get more complex:

* Depending on the chemistry used by the battery cell, it can be [rechargeable](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/), or it is designed for [one-time use](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/primary/) only (discardable).
* The chemistry inside a battery cell determines its voltage and many of its characteristics, i.e. its [shelf life](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/unprotected/) and [energy density](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/unprotected/).
* When battery cells are combined and connected *in series* and/or *in parallel*, the result is a **battery** (aka [battery pack](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/)) with varying voltage and capacity.
* Some battery chemistries like *lithium* are so powerful that they need a [BMS](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/bmsprotected/) to protect them from damage and protect you from fire hazards. Typically, the BMS is [built into the battery](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/bmsprotected/), and you should always [make sure your battery has a BMS](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/bmsprotected/#how-to-determine-if-a-battery-has-a-built-in-bms), but you can also explicitly get batteries with **no BMS** (unprotected). Such batteries have a [balancer cable](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/unprotected/) instead so you can shift the tasks of a BMS to external components and save weight and cost.


In this section, you find basic information helping you to better understand various battery types, and picking the correct battery type for your next project:

* What are the [different chemistries](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/) used in batteries in general, and how do they differ in terms of energy density, shelf life, and cost?
* Why can [discardable](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/primary/) batteries not be recharged like [rechargeable](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/) batteries?
* What are the [chemistries](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/#chemistry-types) used in rechargeable batteries, and how do they compare?
* What is the difference between a battery cell and a [battery pack](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/)?
* How can I [test](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytesters/) the quality and state of charge of a battery?
* What is a [BMS](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/bmsprotected/), and how can I [find out if my battery has one](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/bmsprotected/#how-to-determine-if-a-battery-has-a-built-in-bms)?
* Why do some rechargeable batteries have [no BMS and a balancer cable instead](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/batterytypes/rechargeable/batterypacks/unprotected/)?
* What are [fake batteries](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/fakebatteries/), and how can I identify them?
