# DC-DC Converters

> Modern Electronic Circuits To Lower Or Raise DC Voltage And Limit Current


Modern *"switching"* DC-DC converters are an [essential part of most power supplies](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/#voltage-regulators). 


## Overview
*DC-DC converters* have [already been discussed](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/#voltage-regulators). If you are interested in what a *DC-DC converter* actually **is**, and how it works, please review it [here](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/#voltage-regulators).

*This* section is looking at *generic DC-DC converters* that are available separately and can be used in DIY projects to lower, raise, or stabilize voltages and limit currents.


### Special Use-Cases
Be aware that there are at least two *specialty* use-cases for *DC-DC converters* that are discussed separately elsewhere:

* [Battery charging:](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/chargers/): uses *DC-DC converters* with *separated* buck (charge) and boost (discharge) functionality for powerbank scenarios, and to supply battery power to portable electronics.        
* [Harvesting solar energy](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/solar/): uses *DC-DC converters* with *adjustable duty cycle* to support efficient *MPPT solar charging*

The [IP5306](https://done.land/components/power/powersupplies/battery/chargers/charge-discharge/ip5306/) for example is an excellent and highly integrated *DC-DC converter chip* that comes with *separate* boost and buck technology to address both charging and discharging scenarios in powerbanks and battery-operated devices. It does so with minimum size at high performance (*10W*) by using latest and highly efficient regulator technology.
