> All About Solar Panels and How to Power DIY Projects with Them

*Solar energy* is a convenient way to power devices and can provide an endless energy source, perfect for remotely located sensors. It can also charge power banks or smartphones during outdoor adventures, like mountain trips. In this guide, we’ll explore all the components needed to harness energy from sunlight, whether your goal is small-scale power (e.g., for sensors or microcontrollers) or large-scale power (e.g., to supply your entire household from a rooftop array).

## Overview
To capture and utilize energy from sunlight, you'll need the following components:

### Harvesting Power

* **Solar Panel:** A solar panel (or an array) captures *photons* from sunlight and converts them into electrical current. Power output is directly tied to light intensity, meaning that by itself, a *solar panel* is not a stable power source; *current* and *voltage* fluctuate significantly.
* **Solar Charge Controller:** This device stabilizes the fluctuating current from your solar panels, converting it into a consistent voltage suitable for battery charging. *Charge controllers* also include *safety mechanisms* to prevent battery *overcharging* and *undervoltage*.
* **Rechargeable Battery:** Acting as an energy reservoir, a battery accumulates incoming solar power and stores it until needed. Since solar input is variable, the battery serves as a *buffer*—storing energy during sunshine hours and releasing it when demand arises.

### Using Power

To power devices from stored solar energy, these components are essential:

* **Battery Management System (BMS):** The BMS ensures safe battery usage, preventing excessive discharge and protecting against *deep-discharge*, both of which can damage batteries.
* **Converter:** If the battery voltage differs from what your device requires, a *converter* adjusts it to the necessary level. For household appliances, you’ll need an *AC converter*—it not only adjusts the voltage (e.g., from battery level to *220V* household standard) but also converts *DC* from the battery to *AC* for home use.
