> Turning Batteries Into Powerbanks

Lithium-based rechargeable batteries feature *high energy density* and can store huge amounts of energy in a small space. But only when equipped with additional electronic circuitry will they become a useful *powerbank*.

## Turning Batteries in Powerbanks

A *rechargeable battery* acts like the raw *storage tank* of a *powerbank*. What's missing are the electronics to easily *charge* and *discharge* these batteries. Only then will a *battery* become a *powerbank*.

### Required Components

A *powerbank* adds the following components:

* **Charger:** accepts a common input voltage (such as *USB* voltages) and converts it to the *charging voltage* and *current* required for safely charging the internal battery.
* **Battery Management System (BMS):** safeguards the battery and protects it from *over-charging*, *over-discharging*, and *short-circuiting*.
* **Output Voltage Converter:** Circuitry that converts the native battery voltage to useful voltages, i.e. *5V USB* for charging USB devices, or even digital logic to support a variety of quick charging protocols.

### Optional Components

Typically, *powerbanks* also include the following *optional* components:


* **Visuals:** *LED Bars*, *digital displays*, etc. to indicate the current *state of charge*.
* **Button:** turns on the electronics whenever power needs to be drawn from the *powerbank*. This way, the electronics can go to sleep when not in use. This prevents the battery from silently discharging over time.

## DIY Powerbank

*Powerbanks* can be easily designed and built. The required components are readily available. This section introduces and explains typical examples.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always keep in mind that *powerbanks* deal with huge amounts of energy and can be dangerous when built improperly. *Lithium batteries* used inside a *powerbank* can draw *huge currents*. When the batteries are not properly protected by a *BMS*, or when wiring or construction is done improperly, *DIY powerbanks* can  *explode* or *catch fire*. Consider building your own *powerbank* only if you are fully aware of the risks and have appropriate skills.
