# Solar Panels

> Turning Sunlight Into Electicity

*Solar panels* (aka *photovoltaic modules*) consist of thin layers of *polycristalline* or *monocrystalline* silicon, with the latter being more expensive but also more efficient.

## How They Work

Silicon is a semiconductor. When photons hit its surface, this dislodges electrons which in turn creates a flow in electric charge. 

Normally, the dislodged electrons would move in random directions and not producing a usable current. By special treatment, *solar panels* make sure the dislodged electrons move in the same direction.

### Small Cells Form Large Panels

*Solar panels* are made of small and independent *cells*: *Monocrystalline silicon cells* typically produce *0.5-0.6V* each. *Polycrystalline cells* reach *0.5-0.55V*.

By connecting these cells *in series*, the overall panel *voltage* can be raised. By connecting cells *in parallel*, the *current* can be raised.

This way, a rich variety of *solar panels* can be produced with different *voltages* and *current*.

## Choosing The Right Panel

Generally, the larger a *solar panel* is, the more energy can it produce. 

The *size* of the solar panel you can afford (to purchase, and to accommodate) is probably the most important decision. *Larger is better* (as long as you can make use of all of the generated power).

### Efficiency
With restricted space, you can compensate this in part by choosing a solar panel with *higher efficiency*. 

Panel *efficiency* tells you how much solar energy can be converted to *electricity*. 

Cheaper polycrystalline silicon cells have a typical efficiency of *15-18%*. *Monocrystalline silicon* cells can achieve efficiencies of *22%* and more.

### Total Maximum Panel Voltage
Solar panels can basically deliver any desired output voltage. This is just a question of the number of internal cells, and how they are connected.

Small solar panels typically come with maximum voltages of *3V*, *5V*, *6V*, *12V*, *18V*, or *24V*.

Choose a solar panel with a total output voltage close to the output voltage you need. *DC-DC conversion* is most efficient when the voltage difference between raw input voltage and fixed output voltage is small.
