# Power-Related Components

> **Check Out Power Devices: Regulators, Batteries, BMS**

Electronics of any kind are driven by *electrical power*, and this section is all about *feeding power to your devices*. 

This includes *voltage* and *current regulators* that you can use for your devices to provide a stable and safe *voltage* (or *current*). 

It also *batteries* and their *battery management systems*, and I am talking about the most fundamental thing of them all: safely *measuring voltage* and *current*.

### Constant Voltage (CV) / Constant Current (CC)
* **[Adjusting Voltage And/Or Limiting Current](DC-DC-Converters)**: I am looking at *Buck* and *Boost* converters, and combinations, and explain differences between readily available breakout boards.

### Batteries
* **[Protecting Lithium Batteries with a BMS](BMS)**: Rechargeable batteries are a great power source. For safe operations, both *charging* and *discharging* needs careful attention and protection. That's what a **BMS** (*Battery Management System*) does. Here, I am discussing what a **BMS** does, which types there are, and when you need one. I am also looking at readily available low-cost **BMS** breakout boards that you can easily add to your projects.

### Measuring And Monitoring
* **[Measuring Current](Measuring%20Current)**: There are many very good reasons why measuring *current* can be useful, and I am sharing some ideas here. Primarily though, I look at different ways to safely measure *currents*, both small currents and huge currents.
