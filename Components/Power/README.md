## Power-Related Components

In this section I discuss components used for **Power Management**:

### Constant Voltage (CV) / Constant Current (CC)
* **[Adjusting Voltage And/Or Limiting Current](DC-DC-Converters)**: I am looking at *Buck* and *Boost* converters, and combinations, and explain differences between readily available breakout boards.

### Batteries
* **[Protecting Lithium Batteries with a BMS](BMS)**: Rechargeable flexibly provide power. For safe operations, both *charging* and *discharging* needs careful attention and protection. That's what a **BMS** (*Battery Management System*) does. Here, I am discussing what a **BMS** does, which types there are, and when you need one. I am also looking at readily available low-cost **BMS** breakout boards that you can easily add to your projects.

### Measuring And Monitoring
* **[Measuring Current](Measuring%20Current)**: There are many very good reasons why measuring *current* can be useful, and I am sharing some ideas here. Primarily though, I look at different ways to safely measure *currents*, both small currents and huge currents.
