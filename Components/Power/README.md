# Power-Related Components

> **Check Out Power Devices: Regulators, Batteries, BMS**

Electronics of any kind are driven by *electrical power*, and this section is all about *handling electrical power*. 

## Voltage and Current

All starts with *voltage* and *current* - and the many ways to *[measure](Measuring%20Current)* and *monitor* both. 

This is the foundation on which tools like *multimeters*, *oscilloscopes* but also devices like *voltage regulators*, *chargers* and *battery protection systems* (BMS) operate.


## Constant Voltage (CV) / Constant Current (CC)

At minimum, you need to supply a *stable voltage* to your devices. Neither a simple *AC* power supply nor a *battery* alone are sufficient because their output voltage *fluctuates* and may not even be at all in the *voltage range* your device requires. 

You frequently need a *constant voltage* [regulator](DC-DC-Converters) that accepts a wide range of input voltage and provides a *fixed* and *stable* output voltage.

## Batteries

Rechargeable batteries are a great power source. For safe operations, both *charging* and *discharging* needs careful monitoring and protection. 

That's what a [BMS](BMS) (*Battery Management System*) does: it carefully monitors both *voltage* and *current* to make sure you are not *over-charging* or drawing *too much energy* from your battery.
