# Components

> **Pick a Component Category and Find the Best Component for Your Needs**

Often you might know *what* you want to do but are uncertain *how* to do it, or what could be the *best* component for your use case.

For almost anything there is a rich choice of *Breakout Boards* and *Components* available. I have categorized them for you, show-case them and share the differences, test results, and true specs.

Simply pick a *category* in the left sidebar, then click on the *topic* that interests you.
