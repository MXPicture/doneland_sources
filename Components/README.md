# Components

> **Pick a Component Category and Find the Best Component for Your Needs**

Often you might know *what* you want to do but are uncertain *how* to do it, or what could be the *best* component for your use case.

For almost anything there is a rich choice of *Breakout Boards* and *Components* available. I have categorized them for you, show-case them and share the differences, test results, and true specs.

* **[Power](power):** All about *Power*-related devices. I cover *voltage* and *current regulators*, *constant voltage* and *constant current*, *batteries*, *charger*, *BMS (battery management systems)*, and I'll cover the best ways of actually *measuring voltage* and *current*.
