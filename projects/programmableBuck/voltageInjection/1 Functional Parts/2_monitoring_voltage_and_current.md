# Step 2: Monitoring Voltage And Current
:stopwatch: Reading time: 5 minutes.

## Quick Overview

The microcontroller needs to know the actual *voltage* and *current* before it can tell the **Buck** breakout board what to do. This part looks at *how* a microcontroller like the *ESP8266* can monitor *current* and *voltage* of *any* power supply.

You can re-use this logic for many other purposes, i.e. to monitor batteries or build your own *Coloumbmeters*.

### Analog-To-Digital Converter (ADC) Reads Voltages

The *voltage* and *current* measuring is done by a **ADS1115**: a cheap and precise 12-bit *ADC* (Analog-To-Digital-Converter). 

It comes with four inputs marked as *AIN0* to *AIN3*. The chip communicates via **I2C** so it is connected to the microcontroller with just two wires: *SCL* and *SDA*.

> [!NOTE]  
> Most microcontrollers like *Arduino* and *ESP8266* come with their own *ADC* built-in. You could skip the *ADS1115* and use the built-in *ADC* instead to save a bit.
>
> However, the built-in *ADC*s are much less precise and much more susceptible to external influences. In an application that is designed to control output *voltage* and *current* of a power supply you need precise and robust readings. After all, you cannot have an unexpected voltage surge just because there is noise on the line.
>
> It's well invested money to use external *ADC*s in your projects. After all, a *ADS1115* cost less than â‚¬2 and is well worth it.

### Measuring Voltage

The *voltage* is measured by *AIN0* and *AIN1*: *AIN0* is connected to the positive *output* voltage, and *AIN1* is connected to **GND**. The measured *difference* is the *output voltage*.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Most *ADC*s can measure only a limited voltage range and are very sensitive to over-voltage. That's why the *ADS11215* cannot measure the output voltage directly. It is too high.
>
> Instead, a *voltage divider* is used (*R11* and *R12*). The resistor values *1K* and *10K* drop the measured voltage by factor 10 so it is now in the safe range for the *ADS1115* input.

> Even though the *ADS1115* comes with *four* independent inputs and can measure *four* different input voltages against **GND**, it alternatively supports a *differential mode* where it can measure *voltage differences* between two inputs, respectively. This *can* be more precise, and it *can* be used to also measure negative voltages.
>
> However, nothing is won if the second input is connected to **GND** (which is what the one-pin input does by default).
>
> I may be overlooking the obvious, and will investigate further, but on first sight it appears as if *AIN1* could safely be used for other purposes: *AIN0' would yield the same result when used in default *single pin* mode.

### Meassuring Current (Indirectly Via Voltage)

*Current* cannot be measured directly. An *ADC* can measure *voltage* only. One way of measuring *current* is by measuring the *voltage drop* at a low-resistance *shunt* resistor.

The **Buck** converter used here has a shunt resistor mounted on its back and uses it internally to measure the output current. The shunt resistor is connected in series between **GND** input and **GND** output: the other two *ADC* inputs (*AIN2* and *AIN3*) are therefore connected to the **output GND** and the **input GND**.

Since the voltage drop typically is a very low voltage, no additional *voltage divider* is required here. 

> [!TIP]
> To create the digitally controllable **Buck** converter, all we need is a way for the microprocessor to know the *voltage* and *current*.
>
> Using an **ADS1115** and taking advantage of the *shunt resistor* built into the **Buck** converter (as illustrated here) is one clever way of doing so. There are many alternatives, though. You could use a *hall sensor* to measure *current* (i.e. if you wanted to adapt this concept to different **Buck** converters that have no easily accessible *shunt resistor*), or use your own *shunt resistor*.
>
> In fact, there are cheap boards available based on *INA226* or *INA3221* that do *current* and *voltage* measuring via *I2C* as a one-stop solution. They are also super cheap. However, most of them use *R100* shunt resistors and can only handle a maximum of **3A**. 

### Building And Testing

The actual *building* and testing, including *programming* the microprocessor and adjusting the raw input readings from *ADS1115* to display the measured *voltage* and *current* on a *OLED* display can be found here (TBD, coming soon).


### Next Step

Now that our microcontroller can monitor *voltage* and *current*, it is timne to *control* them. This is done by *injecting* voltages into the **Buck** controller to mimick a change in the manual potentiometers. [The next part has the details](3_injecting_voltage.md).
