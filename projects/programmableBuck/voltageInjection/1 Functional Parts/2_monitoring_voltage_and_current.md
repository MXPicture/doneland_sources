# Step 2: Monitoring Voltage And Current
:stopwatch: Reading time: 5 minutes.

## Concept

The microcontroller needs to know the actual *voltage* and *current* before it can tell the **Buck** breakout board what to do, so the next step is to implement a way how the microcontroller can find out these values.

Here is the part of the schematics that does this:

> [!TIP]
> There are many ways to monitor *voltage* and *current*. If you prefer an alternative way that you feel more confident with, go ahead. You can then skip this part and move on to the [next part](3_injecting_voltage.md). Al that matters is that your microcontroller knows the *current* and *voltage* at the output pins of the **Buck** converter.
>
> For example, you could use a *hall sensor* to measure *current* (i.e. if you wanted to adapt this concept to different **Buck** converters that have no easily accessible *shunt resistor* necessarily), or use your own *shunt resistor*.
>
> In fact, there are cheap boards available based on *INA226* or *INA3221* that do *current* and *voltage* measuring via *I2C* as a one-stop solution. They are also super cheap. However, most of them use *R100* shunt resistors and can only handle a maximum of **3A**.

The *voltage* and *current* measuring is done by a **ADS1115**: a cheap and precise 16-bit *ADC* (Analog-To-Digital-Converter). 

* **Do not use internal *ADC***: While you could try and use the on-board *ADC* that comes with your microprocessor, the â‚¬1-2 spent for an external *ADC* like *ADS1115* are well invested. It has a much higher precision and robustness. That's important when its readings are supposed to control voltage and currency.
* **Two Voltages Are Measured**: *ADS1115* comes with four inputs that can measure voltages independently. Or you combine two inputs to measure the voltage difference between these. That's how it is done in this project.
* **Voltage Measurement**: The *voltage* is measured by *AIN0* and *AIN1*: *AIN0* is connected to the positive *output* voltage, and *AIN1* is connected to **GND**. The measured *difference* is the *output voltage*. Most *ADC*s can measure only a limited voltage range and are very sensitive to over-voltage. That's why the *ADS11215* cannot measure the output voltage directly. It is too high.
* **Current Measurement Via Voltage Drop**: Current is measured as *voltage drop* at a *shunt resistor*. The shunt resistor built into the **Buck** converter is connected in series between **GND** input and **GND** output: the other two *ADC* inputs (*AIN2* and *AIN3*) are therefore connected to the **output GND** and the **input GND**. Since the voltage drop is typically a very low voltage, no additional *voltage divider* is required here. 

> Should you *not* find a big black *R050* *shunt resistor* on the back of your **Buck** converter then you might be using a different model.
>
> Natively, the *XL4015* chip used in these converters supports just *constant voltage* but does *not* support *constant current*. It is the discrete logic on the breakout board that *adds* *constant current* capabilities, and there are breakout boards out there that look much alike but are missing the additional **CC** logic (in which case you can still use the board in this project, but you will only be able to control voltage, not current).
>
> The external **CC** logic consists primarily of a *shunt resistor* (to measure current, like we do), a *potentiometer* to adjust *constant current* (so these boards have *two* potentiometers and not just one), and an *OpAmp* (that produces the actual control signal to tell the *XL4015* to lower its voltage when there is an over-current).

## Solder Points

To measure voltage and current, add wires to the **Buck** converter at the marked pins below. If you use a 6-pin connector, then you can easily attach and detach your control logic later (i.e. to test it with different **Buck** converters).

The actual *building* and testing, including *programming* the microprocessor and adjusting the raw input readings from *ADS1115* to display the measured *voltage* and *current* on a *OLED* display can be found here (TBD, coming soon).


## Next Step

Now that our microcontroller can monitor *voltage* and *current*, it is time to *control* them. This is done by *injecting* voltages into the **Buck** controller to mimick a change in the manual potentiometers. [The next part has the details](3_injecting_voltage.md).
