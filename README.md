# Welcome to **Done Land** 

Welcome to this repository: here you find information about electronic components, microcontrollers, plus many examples illustrating actual usage.

All content focuses on *practical use* and quick success. It may not always be scientifically correct down to the last detail as long as it is simple to understand and of immediate and safe practical use.

> [!TIP]
> If you find *practically* incorrect statements or would like to add your own tricks and insights, please go to the menu on top of this page and file an [issue](/../../issues), or visit the [discussion](/../../discussions) forum.
> 
> We focus on *practically relevant* information. Please do not file an issue if you feel that there is an *academic* issue with terminology used or explanations given.
> 
> Should you find information that is simply *wrong* or would even lead to *damage* or *malfunction*, or if you'd like to share own *practically relevant* experience, you are most welcome.

This repository grows as I move along. I'd be thrilled if some of the content is useful for you.

## Discrete Components

Single parts of electrical circuits with one dominant function:

* [Transistors](components/basic/transistor)

## DC-DC Converters

Chips that can *lower* or *raise* an input voltage. Important part of a *power supply* to ensure your devices and projects receive the appropriate *voltage* and/or *current*.

Chips are typically sold embedded in a ready-to-go breakout board.

### Buck-Converter (lowering the voltage)

* [XL4005](components/power/DC-DC-Converter/buck/XL4005)
* [XL4015](components/power/DC-DC-Converter/buck/XL4015)
*  [XL4016](components/power/DC-DC-Converter/buck/XL4016)
