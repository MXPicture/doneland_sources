# **Electronics101** Start Page

Welcome to this repository: here you find information about electronic components, microcontrollers, plus many examples illustrating actual usage.

All content focuses on *practical use* and quick success. It may not always be scientifically correct down to the last detail as long as it is simple to understand and of immediate and safe practical use.

> [!TIP]
> If you find *practically* incorrect statements or would like to add your own tricks and insights, please go to the menu on top of this page and file an issue, or visit the discussion forum.
> 
> We only focus on *practically relevant* information. Please do not file an issue if you feel that there is an *academic* issue with terminology used or explanations given.
> 
> Should you find information that is simply *wrong* or would even lead to *damage* or *malfunction*, or if you'd like to share own *practically relevant* experience, you are most welcome.

This repository grows as I move along. I'd be thrilled if some of the content is useful for you.
