# Welcome to DONE.LAND! 

> **A Place for Makers, Geeks and the Technically Inspired who Enjoy Playing with Electronics and Microprocessors**

I am originally a *software and automation expert* but started to realize how useful it is to dive into *electronics* and the world of *microprocessors* like **ESP8266**. 

There is a huge community, great resources and tons of ideas. 

## Why bother when there is *Amazon* and *AliExpress*?

Why would anyone bother *building electronics yourself*?

Here is why: a good friend needed a device that *monitors loud noise*, and when the volume is over a threshold, he wanted to *cut off electricity* and *Internet access*. This device was supposed to be deployed into his daughters' room. 

You can't buy these things. But you can make them. And it doesn't take much, neither money nor time. It does take knowledge, though. And it is rewarding fun each time you *understand* something new and extend your skill set.

## Thank You, Community!

I visited many great resources, watched well-made YouTube videos, and am grateful for the generous sharing of so many people in forums, on youtube, or websites like *instructables*.

What irritated me was that in the web, the *same* questions were asked over and over again, and rather than just getting a no nonsense answer, often the key information was burried in a lot of noise.

The *one thing* that is scarce for most people is *quality time*: I wished there were more places that provide just the knowledge in a well discoverable way. 

## Giving Back

While working on my projects and experiments, I decided to take the time and *document* my findings. The result is this website. 

It is a huge *work in progress*, and aside from *electronics* I am also working many nights on *web design*, *github actions* and *image processing*, just to mention a few, in my effort to provide you and me with a clean and discoverable information resource. 


## Feel Free to Contribute, Too!

You are cordially invited to harvest as much information from here as you wish. No need to give back anything.

If you do come across errors or would like to add a piece of knowledge, please leave a comment below.

> [!NOTE]
> This website is about *practical* know-how and may not always be academically correct. Please save your time if you are concerned about *perfect terminology* or would like to highlight the *true physical processes* of something I describe. While that's great, what solely matters *here* is that things are *understandable* and of *practical use* - even at the expense of slight inaccuracies or over-simplifications that a true electrical engineer would never allow.  

Here are your paths to contribute:

* **Comments:** If you find typos or would like to add *practically relevant* comments and corrections, the simplest form of feedback is to leave a comment below.

* **Discussions:** A slightly more sophisticated approach is to visit the [discussion](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources/discussions) forum.

* **Filing Issues:** The best way to add content or fix typos is to file an [issue](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources/issues). This incorporates your input into a managed "ticket system" and helps keeping track of what has been fixed, and what still needs attention.
