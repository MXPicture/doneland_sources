# Welcome to DONE.LAND! 

> **A Place for Makers, Geeks and the Technically Inspired who Enjoy Playing with Electronics and Microprocessors**

I am originally a *software and automation expert* but started to realize how useful it is to dive into *electronics* and the world of *microprocessors* like **ESP8266**. 

There is a huge community, great resources and tons of ideas. Right here, you find information and ideas about the parts, components and microprocessors I came across.

<details>
<summary>Why bother making things when there is Amazon and AliExpress?</summary><br/>

Here is why: a good friend needed a device that *monitors loud noise*, and when the volume is over a threshold, he wanted to *cut off electricity* and *Internet access*. This device was supposed to be deployed into his daughters' room. 

You can't buy these things. But you can make them. And it doesn't take much, neither money nor time. It does take knowledge, though. And it is rewarding fun each time you *understand* something new and extend your skill set.

</details>
<details><summary>And why does this site exist?</summary><br/>

I visited many great resources, watched well-made YouTube videos, and am grateful for the generous sharing of so many people in forums, on youtube, or websites like *instructables*.

What irritated me was that in the web, the *same* questions were asked over and over again, and rather than just getting a no nonsense answer, often the key information was burried in a lot of noise.

The *one thing* that is scarce for most people is *quality time*: I wished there were more places that provide just the knowledge in a well discoverable way. 

While working on my projects and experiments, I decided to take the time and *document* my findings. The result is this website. 

It is a huge *work in progress*, and aside from *electronics* I am also working many nights on *web design*, *github actions* and *image processing*, just to mention a few, in my effort to provide you and me with a clean and discoverable information resource. 
</details>

## Components

Whenever I come across a new *component* like a display, a regulator or whatnot, I am documenting it in the [Components](components) section.

It's a great place to *compare* components and find out which is best suited for a particular idea. 

It's also helpful to *review specs*. Vendors like *AliExpress* often do not provide *all* the necessary specs, and occasionally the specs they do mention are wrong or apply only in very unrealistic scenarios.

If a *component* requires *software*, i.e. to work with a [Rotary Encoder](Components/Human%20Interface/Rotary%20Encoder) or a display, often you'll also find *example code* and references to the libraries you need.

## Fundamentals

*Learning* is a great part of any journey into microelectronics as most of us probably are no genuine electrical engineers. 

Whenever I hit something *fundamentally new*, I'll add it to [Fundamentals](Fundamentals) for easy lookup. For example, [Transistors](Fundamentals/Discrete/Transistor) play a *fundamental* role in almost any circuit. If you can't remember the difference between *P-* and *N-*, or would like to find the best transistor type for a given task, go have a look.


## Projects

*Projects* are what drives me. In my projects, I can combine *components* to *test* ideas and *invent* new gizmos. So in [Projects](Projects) I document my projects in a step-by-step way that anyone can rebuild (and expand and improve) them.


## Tools

While working on electronics and on this site, occasionally I come across tasks that are *hard to do*, and the reason most often is that I am missing the appropriate *tools*.

Whenever that happens I start to search for *new tools*, and if I can't find any, I create my own. In [Tools](Tools) I am show-casing all tools I find helpful. I am also sharing the *commands* and *PowerShell Modules* I created to help me produce better results in less time.


## Split Personality: Github and The Web

The website [done.land](https://done.land) is driven by a [github repository](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources). You can visit either one of these siblings.

The *repository* keeps and organizes all content, and also hosts all [Comments](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources/discussions).

The *website* is *automatically generated* off of the repository. It provides the final browsing and reading experience.

### Benefits and Advantages

You can enjoy both places, each has its own advantages:

* **Data Oriented:** the *repository* is *data driven*, and in the upper part you always see an *explorer-like file view*. This is especially helpful for articles with extensive attached code examples, but you can also *navigate* the site by clicking *folders*. By convention, folder names starting with a *capital letter* are public content. When a folder name is *all lower-case*, you can still explore it but most likely its content serves internal purposes and looking inside is as thrilling as unscrewing the cover of your *coffee machine* (when you really just want a *cappucchino*).
* **Search Oriented:** the *website* is *search-oriented*: click the *search icon* in the upper right corner to quickly search for terms or model names. The *right* sidebar provides easy *headline navigation*, and the *left sidebar* lists *related topics*


### Switching Back and Forth

You can easily switch between *Github* and the *Web*: at the bottom of each page, you find *links* respective *buttons* to switch to the *sibling page*.

Here is an example: [this article](Components/Human%20Interface/Rotary%20Encoder/Using%20Mechanical%20Rotary%20Encoder) explains how to hook up a *Rotary Encoder* to a microprocessor. 

You can start reading the article as a [Webpage](https://done.land/components/humaninterface/rotaryencoder/usingmechanicalrotaryencoder). Once you are ready to dig deeper and actually use the attached code, i.e. in *platformio* or the *Arduino IDE*, simply switch to the [Github Repo Version](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources/tree/main/Components/Human%20Interface/Rotary%20Encoder/Using%20Mechanical%20Rotary%20Encoder) of the same page. One easy way is to use the *green* button **Show on Github** that you find at the bottom of any webpage on my site.

Now you see the *file explorer* in the upper half and can easily navigate the example subfolders. 

## Feel Free to Contribute, Too!

You are cordially invited to harvest as much information from here as you wish. No need for giving back anything.

Then again, you probably know much more than I do in so many areas. If you have *additional information* or *helpful hints*, I'd be thrilled to see you contribute.

Below, you can leave a comment or join *discussions*. 

### Submit Your Own Reviews or Articles

You are cordially invited to participate even more (if you like). Each article is *publicly attributed to its author* next to its title. That's currently always me. 

If you are just as much into electronics like I am and don't want to organize and run a website just to share and show your findings and ideas, then please *do contact me* (by clicking the link *Contact* at the bottom of each page). 

I love to *review devices*, *explain technology & concepts in simple terms*, *show off little projects*, etc pp - maybe you do, too. 

If ideas resonate, maybe we'll see awesome articles from *you*, too, on this site soon. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Bear in mind this is a non-profit site. All I do here is driven solely by fun and passion.
> Collaborating on this site is *not a job opportunity*. It's a *fun opportunity* at this point.
