# Welcome to DONE.LAND! 

> **A Place for Makers, Geeks and the Technically Inspired who Enjoy Playing with Electronics and Microprocessors**

I am originally a *software and automation expert* but started to realize how useful it is to dive into *electronics* and the world of *microprocessors* like **ESP8266**. 

There is a huge community, great resources and tons of ideas. Right here, you find information and ideas about the parts, components and microprocessors I came across.

<details>
<summary>Why bother making things when there is Amazon and AliExpress?</summary><br/>

Here is why: a good friend needed a device that *monitors loud noise*, and when the volume is over a threshold, he wanted to *cut off electricity* and *Internet access*. This device was supposed to be deployed into his daughters' room. 

You can't buy these things. But you can make them. And it doesn't take much, neither money nor time. It does take knowledge, though. And it is rewarding fun each time you *understand* something new and extend your skill set.

</details>
<details><summary>And why does this site exist?</summary><br/>

I visited many great resources, watched well-made YouTube videos, and am grateful for the generous sharing of so many people in forums, on youtube, or websites like *instructables*.

What irritated me was that in the web, the *same* questions were asked over and over again, and rather than just getting a no nonsense answer, often the key information was burried in a lot of noise.

The *one thing* that is scarce for most people is *quality time*: I wished there were more places that provide just the knowledge in a well discoverable way. 

While working on my projects and experiments, I decided to take the time and *document* my findings. The result is this website. 

It is a huge *work in progress*, and aside from *electronics* I am also working many nights on *web design*, *github actions* and *image processing*, just to mention a few, in my effort to provide you and me with a clean and discoverable information resource.

## Components

Whenever I come across a new *component* like a display, a regulator or whatnot, I am documenting it in the [Components](components) section.

It's a great place to *compare* components and find out which is best suited for a particular idea. 

It's also helpful to *review specs*. Vendors like *AliExpress* often do not provide *all* the necessary specs, and occasionally the specs they do mention are wrong or apply only in very unrealistic scenarios.

If a *component* requires *software*, i.e. to work with a [Rotary Encoder](Components/Human%20Interface/Rotary%20Encoder) or a display, often you'll also find *example code* and references to the libraries you need.

## Fundamentals

*Learning* is a great part of any journey into microelectronics as most of us probably are no genuine electrical engineers. 

Whenever I hit something *fundamentally new*, I'll add it to [Fundamentals](Fundamentals) for easy lookup. For example, [Transistors](Fundamentals/Discrete/Transistor) play a *fundamental* role in almost any circuit. If you can't remember the difference between *P-* and *N-*, or would like to find the best transistor type for a given task, go have a look.


## Projects

*Projects* are what drives me. In my projects, I can combine *components* to *test* ideas and *invent* new gizmos. So in [Projects](Projects) I document my projects in a step-by-step way that anyone can rebuild (and expand and improve) them.


## Tools

While working on electronics and on this site, occasionally I come across tasks that are *hard to do*, and the reason most often is that I am missing the appropriate *tools*.

Whenever that happens I start to search for *new tools*, and if I can't find any, I create my own. In [Tools](Tools) I am show-casing all tools I find helpful. I am also sharing the *commands* and *PowerShell Modules* I created to help me produce better results in less time.


## Split Personality: Github and The Web

My [website](https://done.land/index.html) is driven by my [Github Repository](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources). I am using the latter to create, organize and maintain my content. Whenever the *Github Repo* changes, this is automatically pushed to the website. So you find the same content on both places.

The original material is visible and accessible here at github. For easy accessibility, you find links and buttons at the end of each page that take you to the respective sibling.

### Browsing the Website...

I personally often visit the [website](https://done.land/index.html) for browsing and looking around. It's the *consumer* side for when you are preoccupied with what *you* are currently doing, and just looking for information.

> [!TIP]
> If you are currently viewing this from within *Github*, you can easily switch to the website version of any page: at the bottom you always find a link that takes you to the website sibling.

### ...and Browsing Github

Whenever you want to participate and i.e. file an *issue* or join *discussions*, the [Github Repository](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources) may be a better place to navigate. It provides you at the top with all the usual *Github* collaboration tools.

It's also a great place when you want to work with the *resources* that may be attached to an article: there is always a *file explorer* at the top and the content text at the bottom. So it's easy to browse the attached resources.

Here is an example: [this article](Components/Human%20Interface/Rotary%20Encoder/Using%20Mechanical%20Rotary%20Encoder) explains how to hook up a *Rotary Encoder* to a microprocessor. 

You can start reading the article as a [Webpage](https://done.land/components/humaninterface/rotaryencoder/usingmechanicalrotaryencoder). Once you are ready to dig deeper and actually use the attached code, i.e. in *platformio* or the *Arduino IDE*, simply switch to the [Github Repo Version](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources/tree/main/Components/Human%20Interface/Rotary%20Encoder/Using%20Mechanical%20Rotary%20Encoder) of the same page. One easy way is to use the *green* button **Show on Github** that you find at the bottom of any webpage on my site.

Now you see the *file explorer* in the upper half and can easily navigate the example subfolders. 

> [!TIP]
> Within my *Github Repo*, any subfolder that starts *capitalized* is meant to be a *public resource*. So any folder you see that starts with a capital letter invites you to click on it and see what's inside.
> Any subfolder in *all lower-case* is used for other things, i.e. stores the images for the article. You can visit these, too, of course, but most likely it's a waste of time.



## Feel Free to Contribute, Too!

You are cordially invited to harvest as much information from here as you wish. No need for giving back anything.

You probably know much more than I do in many areas. If you come across *embarrassing errors* or have *additional information*, I'd be thrilled if you contribute.

Here are your paths to contribute:

* **Discussions:** A slightly more sophisticated approach is to visit the [discussion](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources/discussions) forum.

* **Filing Issues:** The best way to add content or fix typos is to file an [issue](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources/issues). This incorporates your input into a managed "ticket system" and helps keeping track of what has been fixed, and what still needs attention.



> [!TIP]
> On each website page, at the bottom you find two buttons. One is labelled **Show on Github** (which brings you to the content page of the *Github Repository* as mentioned before), and the other one is labelled **Submit Issue** (this one lets you file an *issue* that lets you can report errors or add information).
> The button also seeds the issue with the *backlink to the article*. If you file an issue *manually* directly inside *Github*, please add a backlink to what you are referring to. This way I can quickly understand what you are trying to tell me.

<details><summary>Why would you not use a commenting plugin at the bottom of each page?</summary><br/>

I am *not* using the classic *commenting systems* like *Disqus*. Here is why:

* **Spam** and **Ads**: I once used *Disqus* and actually liked it - until they started to inject tons of *ads* into my site. I want this resource to be as clean and distraction-free as possible and not see advertisements for things I do not support. I then reviewed many other *commenting plugins* but they all were either *ad-driven*, *expensive* or vulnerable to *spam*.
* **Actionable** and **Accountable**: I want your input to be *actionable* and keep you informed how your input was used. With classic *commenting systems*, there is no way of following up.

That's why I decided to use the same *professional* "commenting systems" used in software development: *issues*. Similar to a tracking system, you can post *issues*, and whenever you do, a distinct thread is opened that can be followed up and resolved.

For more *unspecific* contact, I also enabled *Github Discussions* which works like a classic *discussion forum*. 

Either way, both are driven by *Github*, and to participate you need a (free) *Github Account*. You cannot post anonymously. And that's a great benefit.

For you, it is easy and *completely free* to set up a *Github Account* (if you have none yet). It comes with a ton of benefits for you: you could create your own repos (like this one), and connect with many other *Github* users.

For me, it's the best way to *lock out spammers* and also *come back to you*: when you ask a question or generously contribute knowledge, I can mention you, give credit, and send back feedback to you.

And the best thing is: you are not *exposing your privacy*: when you sign up with *Github*, you get a *anonymized email address*. *Github* manages the message exchange between you and me, but no one can harvest your *email address* and spam you.
