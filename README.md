# Welcome to DONE.LAND! 

> **A Place for Makers, Geeks and the Technically Inspired who Enjoy Playing with Electronics and Microprocessors**

I am originally a *software and automation expert* but started to realize how useful it is to dive into *electronics* and the world of *microprocessors* like **ESP8266**. 

There is a huge community, great resources and tons of ideas. Right here, you find information and ideas about the parts, components and microprocessors I came across.

<details>
<summary>Why bother making things when there is Amazon and AliExpress?</summary><br/>

Here is why: a good friend needed a device that *monitors loud noise*, and when the volume is over a threshold, he wanted to *cut off electricity* and *Internet access*. This device was supposed to be deployed into his daughters' room. 

You can't buy these things. But you can make them. And it doesn't take much, neither money nor time. It does take knowledge, though. And it is rewarding fun each time you *understand* something new and extend your skill set.

</details>
<details><summary>And why does this site exist?</summary><br/>

I visited many great resources, watched well-made YouTube videos, and am grateful for the generous sharing of so many people in forums, on youtube, or websites like *instructables*.

What irritated me was that in the web, the *same* questions were asked over and over again, and rather than just getting a no nonsense answer, often the key information was burried in a lot of noise.

The *one thing* that is scarce for most people is *quality time*: I wished there were more places that provide just the knowledge in a well discoverable way. 

While working on my projects and experiments, I decided to take the time and *document* my findings. The result is this website. 

It is a huge *work in progress*, and aside from *electronics* I am also working many nights on *web design*, *github actions* and *image processing*, just to mention a few, in my effort to provide you and me with a clean and discoverable information resource.

## Components

Whenever I come across a new *component* like a display, a regulator or whatnot, I am documenting it in the [Components](components) section.

It's a great place to *compare* components and find out which is best suited for a particular idea. 

It's also helpful to *review specs*. Vendors like *AliExpress* often do not provide *all* the necessary specs, and occasionally the specs they do mention are wrong or apply only in very unrealistic scenarios.

If a *component* requires *software*, i.e. to work with a [Rotary Encoder](Components/Human%20Interface/Rotary%20Encoder) or a display, often you'll also find *example code* and references to the libraries you need.

## Fundamentals

*Learning* is a great part of any journey into microelectronics as most of us probably are no genuine electrical engineers. 

Whenever I hit something *fundamentally new*, I'll add it to [Fundamentals](Fundamentals) for easy lookup. For example, [Transistors](Fundamentals/Discrete/Transistor) play a *fundamental* role in almost any circuit. If you can't remember the difference between *P-* and *N-*, or would like to find the best transistor type for a given task, go have a look.


## Projects

*Projects* are what drives me. In my projects, I can combine *components* to *test* ideas and *invent* new gizmos. So in [Projects](Projects) I document my projects in a step-by-step way that anyone can rebuild (and expand and improve) them.


## Tools

While working on electronics and on this site, occasionally I come across tasks that are *hard to do*, and the reason most often is that I am missing the appropriate *tools*.

Whenever that happens I start to search for *new tools*, and if I can't find any, I create my own. In [Tools](Tools) I am show-casing all tools I find helpful. I am also sharing the *commands* and *PowerShell Modules* I created to help me produce better results in less time.

## Feel Free to Contribute, Too!

You are cordially invited to harvest as much information from here as you wish. No need for giving back anything.

It is more than likely though that you know much more than I do in many areas, so if you come across obvious errors or have additional information, I'd be thrilled if you contribute.

I am *not* using the classic *commenting systems* like *Disqus*. If you'd like to get in touch and/or provide content, please use one of the paths outlined below.

<details><summary>Why would you not use a commenting plugin at the bottom of each page?</summary><br/>

Here is why:

* **Spam** and **Ads**: I once used *Disqus* and actually liked it - until they started to inject tons of *ads* into my site. I want this resource to be as clean and distraction-free as possible and not see advertisements for things I do not support. I then reviewed many other *commenting plugins* but they all were either *ad-driven*, *expensive* or vulnerable to *spam*.
* **Actionable** and **Accountable**: I want your input to be *actionable* and keep you informed how your input was used. With classic *commenting systems*, there is no way of following up.

That's why I decided to use the same *professional* "commenting systems" used in software development: *issues*. Similar to a tracking system, you can post *issues*, and whenever you do, a distinct thread is opened that can be followed up and resolved.

For more *unspecific* contact, I also enabled *Github Discussions* which works like a classic *discussion forum*. 

Either way, both are driven by *Github*, and to participate you need a (free) *Github Account*. You cannot post anonymously. And that's a great benefit.

For you, it is easy and *completely free* to set up a *Github Account* (if you have none yet). It comes with a ton of benefits for you: you could create your own repos (like this one), and connect with many other *Github* users.

For me, it's the best way to *lock out spammers* and also *come back to you*: when you ask a question or generously contribute knowledge, I can mention you, give credit, and send back feedback to you.

And the best thing is: you are not *exposing your privacy*: when you sign up with *Github*, you get a *anonymized email address*. *Github* manages the message exchange between you and me, but no one can harvest your *email address* and spam you.

Here are your paths to contribute:

* **Discussions:** A slightly more sophisticated approach is to visit the [discussion](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources/discussions) forum.

* **Filing Issues:** The best way to add content or fix typos is to file an [issue](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/doneland_sources/issues). This incorporates your input into a managed "ticket system" and helps keeping track of what has been fixed, and what still needs attention.


> [!NOTE]
> Before you submit feedback: this website is about *practical* know-how and may not always be academically correct. If you are concerned about *perfect terminology* or would like to highlight the *true physical processes* of something, then that's great but not necessarily what I am looking for. 
>
> If you have feedback to make things more *understandable* or *easier* - even at the expense of slight inaccuracies or over-simplifications that a true electrical engineer would never allow - then I'd be thrilled to hear from you. Even more so if you come across outright false or - may God forbid - dangerous content.  

> [!TIP]
> If you are viewing this page as part of the *website*, you'll find two buttons at the bottom of each web page: one directs you to the content page of the *Github Repository* that feeds the web page, and the other button lets you file an *issue*.
>
> If you are viewing this page on *Github*, you'll find a link to the sibling web page at the bottom.
>
> When you use the button *Submit Issue* on the website, the new issue is seeded with the backlink to the page so I better know what you are talking about. If you open an *issue* manually, make sure you include a link to the page with the problem yourself.

## Visit Github, or Visit the Web

This repository is mirrored as a [website](https://powershell.one/doneland_test/index.html). The original material is visible and accessible here at github. For easy accessibility, you find links and buttons at the end of each page that take you to the respective sibling.
