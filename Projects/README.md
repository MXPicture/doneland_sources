You can see just *how much* people love to play with displays, buttons, LEDs and other electronic parts when you browse the web or YouTube. That's awesome. Frequently though there is not really a *use case*.

Which is ok. Maybe you love to build a miniature traffic light, or feel deep satisfaction when you dim LEDs with PWM. What is considered *useful* always lays in the eye of the maker.

Here I am documenting *my own projects* that I found *useful*, including schematics and all other information required for easy redo. Maybe you find some of them useful, too.
