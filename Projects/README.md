# Projects

> A place for articles and side projects that don't fit anywhere else.

Most of my *projects* and *examples* are **not found** in **this section**. They are embedded into the articles about the *components* they use. 

> [!TIP]
> *Sample code* for creating precise *CO2 air quality sensors* based on *Sensirion SCD30* can i.e. be found right on the [page about SCD30](https://done.land/components/sensor/airquality/scd30). Should you prefer to use this sensor with [ESPHome](https://done.land/tools/software/esphome), you find a *configuration* for such a sensor [right in the section about ESPHome](https://done.land/tools/software/esphome/introduction/exampledevices/co2sensor).


The *static structure of this site* helps **me** better organize my articles. 

**You** as a valued visitor should simply use the *search box* to quickly find the information you are looking for.


## Search For Topics

All articles are extensively *indexed* for easy discoverability. 

When you open this sites *search box*, simply enter what you are after, and view matching articles while you type:

1. Click the *magnifying glass icon* at the top right of every page to search this site. 
2. Enter a **component name** such as *SCD30*: you are immediately presented with a list of all articles related to your search phrase, including *example code* as well as *tech specs*.
3. Search for a **soft topic** such as *air quality* or *CO2*: once again, while you still type your search, you are presented with matching articles and can quickly find information and *examples*.

## Projects

So what is the **Projects** section used for? 

It's simply a place for **me** to put any article that *doesn't (yet) fit* into any other category, and that in fact may not even be completed:

* **Preliminary:** articles you find here might be *temporarily located* here - as I may not yet have figured out the best place to put them
* **Incomplete:** articles in this section may not yet be completed: I might still be working on it. If that's the case, check back tomorrow to see if the article evolved.
