# Single-GPIO Bi-Color Signal LED

> Designing A Bi-Color Signal LED Driven By A Single GPIO

The powerstrip uses one *GPIO* per *socket* to switch a load. Optionally, the *state of each GPIO* needs to be visualized. For this, *no extra GPIO* or added complexity is wanted. Instead, in this section you see a few designs on how to create a bi-color *signal LED* that can be directly connected to a *GPIO*. The signal LED then changes color based on the state of the *GPIO*.

There are three different approaches discussed here:

* [Using two separate LEDs on one GPIO](https://done.land/projects/esphome/switchesandcontrollingdevices/remotecontrolledpowerstrip/bi-colorsignalled/twoseparateled)
* Using a bi-polar bi-color LED
* Using a RGB or three-legged bi-color LED
