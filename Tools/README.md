> **Introducing Tools and Utilities that Helped Me a Lot**

Good tools save time and nerve, plus they often improve the quality of your work. 

In this section I am introducing all *tools* and *utilities* that help me do electronics and documenting what I do.

## Creating Great Schematics

For example, I use the free *KiCAD* software to draw schematics. Unfortunately, the only way of exporting available it to "plot" the schematics page to *SVG* vector image. 

On my website, I prefer more predictable *PNG* images. So I created a *PowerShell* module with the tools to take the *svg* file created by *KiCAD*, *crop* the excessive whitespace and replace it by a margin, and then convert the *svg* file to a hi-res *PNG*.

As you see, the tools in this section may not exclusively be related to electronics. I organized my tools in categories for easy discovery. Check out the left sidebar.
