# Tuya

> Using Chinese Tuya Smart Devices

[Tuya](https://www.tuya.com/) is a Chinese company offering an *IoT platform* for vendors of smart devices such as *wireless plugs*, *lights*, and more. 

By contracting with *Tuya*, vendors can create *smart devices* that use the *Tuya app* and *cloud services* and put the label *"works with Tuya"* on them without having to invest into their own cloud infrastructure. So when you come across *smart devices* with the *tuya* logo on them, they are designed and manufactured by many different and largely unknown companies, not by *Tuya*. 

## Why deal with Tuya?
*Smart devices* with *Tuya* logo are *microcontroller-based and *WiFi*- or *Zigbee*-enabled devices at exceptionally low prices. For example, a simple *smart electric plug* with built-in *power meter* (that lets you control electrical devices and household appliances remotely) often cost less than â‚¬3. You would not be able to build such devices from individual components yourself.

*Consumers* control such devices via the [Tuya](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/tuya-smart/id1034649547) or [SmartLife](https://www.tuya.com/product/app-management/all-in-one-app) app that are available for *Android* and *iPhone*. These apps are not great, especially when dealing with many devices, but they get the job done.

### ESPHome And Home Assistant
What makes *Tuya smart devices* exciting is the fact that they are *microcontroller*-based and can be used as part of *automations* in [Home Assistant](https://done.land/tools/software/homeassistant). 

You can even replace their *firmware* to completely disconnected them from *cloud services* and turning them into *locally-controlled* [ESPHome](https://done.land/tools/software/esphome).

* **Home Assistant:** comes with an official *Tuya integration* that discovers all *Tuya*-enabled devices and their *entities* (device features). This integration uses the official *Tuya cloud API* and requires no changes at the device, so it is very simple to set up and use. The downside is that any failure in any part of the cloud service tool chain is a *single point of failure*, and *Tuya devices* become inaccessible if your *Internet connection* fails, the *Home Assistant integration* has a bug, or the *Tuya cloud API* does not respond.
* **ESPHome:** most *Tuya*-enabled devices use microcontrollers supported by *ESPHome*: *ESP8266*, *Beken BK72xx*, and *Realtec RTL87xx*. While not officially supported, you can *replace* their proprietary *firmware* with *ESPHome firmware*, turning the device into a locally controllable *ESPHome device*. This approach requires *expert knowledge* to replace the device *firmware*. In exchange, you *eliminate* all dependencies to the *Internet* and the *Tuya cloud API*. For *Home Assistant*, the device is now an *ESPHome device*, and the *Tuya integration* is no longer used.

### Use Cases
Whether you access *Tuya devices* through the built-in *Tuya integration*, or whether you convert *Tuya devices* to *ESPHome devices*: you can now use *cheap but relatively powerful Chinese hardware* as part of your *home automation*. 

Here are a few examples:

* **Control Applicances and Their Power Consumption:** use simple *smart plugs* to turn devices on and off based on other devices managed by *Home Assistant*. You could i.e. create a physical dashboard with push buttons to control different appliances anywhere in your home. This includes monitoring their power consumption as most *smart plugs* come with *power monitoring functionality*.
* **Build Smart Fire Hazard Protection Systems:** cheap (but reliable) *wireless Tuya smoke detectors* can be turned into a sophisticated *fire alarm network*, and *Home Assistant* can turn on *sirens or alarm lights* when *any* of the smoke detectors triggers, or send off an *email*. Cost of commercial systems with such a feature set would be prohibitive for private homes.
* **Create Open-Source Hue-like Lighting:** There are ubiquous *Tuya* lights and led stripes available, and combined with *Home Assistant*, you can design your own open-source *home light system* that controls *scenes* and can turn on illuminations based on time of day, whether you are at home, or whatnot.

These, and the many other use-cases basically illustrate what *Home Assistant* enables you to do. *Tuya* just adds many more *controllable devices* at a very reasonable cost.

## Caveats

*Tuya* is a *cloud service* that works out of the box and requires next to no user configuration. It is *very easy to use*. Like any cloud service, this comes at a price:

* **Privacy:** *Tuya* knows when you turn on a *smart plug* in your home. Whether that's of concern to you is:  up to you
* **Reliability:** *Tuya smart devices* may stop working when the cloud service stops working. This is always true for devices that you manage via the *Home Assistant integration* (that is *always* controlling devices via the *Tuya cloud API*). The *SmartLife app* can control devices *locally*, too, and may serve as a fallback in case of *Internet outage*.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make up your mind how severely this affects you: it may be ok if the living room light scenes stop working or the garden illumination does not automatically turn on in the evening. If you *rely* on *controlling crucial devices*, avoid *cloud-based* solutions or add a fallback strategy. Such a fallback is sometimes built into the devices: *smart plugs* have a manual switch that always works (provided you have physical access to it).


### Local Control
One way of limiting the risk and improving *reliability* is to control *Tuya devices* **locally**. This is not officially supported by *Tuya*, so it involves either *workarounds* or *replacing Tuya*:

* [Tuya-Local](https://github.com/make-all/tuya-local): an alternate integration for *Home Assistant* that controls devices *locally* and may work without *Internet access*. Setting up *tuya-local* requires *network configuration changes* and figuring out *Tuya secret device keys* - **per device**. It is a *workaround* based on *reverse-engineering the Tuya API*. As such, it may stop working when the *API* changes, it may not be compatible with all device types, and there are regular report that *Internet outages* still caused issues.
* [LibreTiny](https://github.com/libretiny-eu): open-source development platform for *IoT modules* used in *Tuya devices*. This ecosystem consists of tools like [Itchiptool](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/ltchiptool) to read and replace *firmware*, and [esphome-kickstart](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/esphome-kickstart) ready-to-use *binary firmware files* to replace the *proprietary firmware* with *ESPHome firmware*. With *LibreTiny*, you *permanently remove* cloud dependencies and turn the device into a *real local ESPHome device*.

> [!TIP]
> Replacing device firmware with *ESPHome firmware* (or any other) can be done in a number of ways: some exploit bugs in the original firmware and work *wirelessly* (i.e. [Tuya Cloudcutter](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter). Others require opening and sometimes even de-soldering the microcontroller in order to upload a new firmware via *UART programmer*. Replacing *device firmware* is the only solid way of removing *cloud dependencies*, but it is not for the faint-hearted and requires either solid experience or considerable determination.

### Worth the effort?
*"Freeing"* a *Tuya device* from the cloud takes effort, so unless you are genuinely interested in the involved techniques, carefully consider it:

* **Cloud Works Great For Most Users:** Try the official *cloud* approach first, and test the stability **for yourself**. Any part of the *cloud* tool chain is a *single point of failure*: your network setup, ISP, *Home Assistant*, its integration, *Tuya* cloud servers, etc. This explains why the *majority* of users enjoys flawless operation while a few users are regularly hit by frustrating issues and interruptions. With a bit of luck, *Tuya devices* work great for you *as-is*.
* **Solving Old Problems By Creating New Problems:** Always carefully evaluate solutions that claim to work *locally* (like [Tuya-Local](https://github.com/make-all/tuya-local)). Controlling *Tuya devices* locally is based on reverse engineering of the *Tuya local API*, and the result may not be supported for all device types, may require assigning *static IP addresses* or other *network and firewall configurations*, and may *still* require that the official *Tuya cloud API* is regularly contacted to update keys. Such solutions may work beautifully for you, but they are just *workarounds* with a lot of *configuration effort* that *do not really solve* the underlying problem and can stop working at any time (if the *Tuya local API* changes).
* **Great Alternative, But Not For Free:** With [LibreTiny](https://github.com/libretiny-eu), there is a *great* alternative that truly *removes any cloud dependency*. Such a conversion is technically challenging though.


### Conclusion
Evaluate using *Tuya devices* with the official *Home Assistant Tuya integration* first: chances are this works amazingly well for you.

If it does not, or if you'd like to remove *cloud dependency* for other reasons, the only other alternative is to replace the device *firmware* altogether, and use a new firmware that does not require *cloud services* at all. 

If replacing the *device firmware* is over your head, then stick with the official *Tuya cloud*, and limit the use of *Tuya devices* to use cases that you can afford to become temporarily unavailable.
