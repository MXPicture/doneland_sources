# Configuring WiFi

> Making Sure Your ESPHome Device Knows How To Connect To Your WiFi

By now you have uploaded *ESPHome firmware* to your microcontroller - one way or another.

If your *firmware* was *hand-tailored* via a specific *configuration*, it typically already includes the access parameters to automatically connect to your *WiFi*, and you can skip this article: once you reboot the microcontroller, it automatically connects to your *WiFi*.

If you have *provisioned* the microcontroller with a *generic firmware* and not yet configured *WiFi access*, then now is the time to do this: only then will the *ESPHome device* become visible to *ESPHome*.

## Connecting New Device To WiFi

Part of the default *ESPHome* provisioning firmware is *improv_serial* (*improv* via *BLE* is available only for microcontrollers that support *bluetooth* - *ESP32 S2* for example does not support *bluetooth*). 

"Improv_serial* lets you connect to your microcontroller via *USB cable* and configure its *WiFi parameters*.

> [!TIP]
> *Improv_serial* works with almost all microcontroller boards, including the dreaded *ESP32-S2 Mini*. That's because it uses the initial UART (when using *ESP32-S2 Mini, it surfaces as *USBTiny*). It is the *secondary UART* in *ESP32 S2 Mini* (surfacing as *ESP32-S2*) that is invoked by the *firmware upload mode* and is causes so much trouble.


1. Connect the microcontroller via *USB cable* to your computer. **Do not** enable *firmware update mode*. If in doubt, press the *reset* button once. 

2. Make sure you closed all other tools (i.e. the *Adafruit* flasher). Then open the[ESPHome Web Tools](https://web.esphome.io/) in your browser.

3. Click *CONNECT*, and select the microcontroller in the dialog. Then click the *three dot* menu and choose *Configure Wi-Fi*.

4. A dialog opens. Note the *temporary device name* (i.e. *esphome-web-8b87ca*). With this name will the device surface in *ESPHome Dashboard* once you configured *WiFi*.

5. Click *CONNECT TO WI-FI*, select the *WiFi SSID* you want to connect to, and click *CONNECT*. After a few seconds, you get a confirmation that the device is now fully configured.
