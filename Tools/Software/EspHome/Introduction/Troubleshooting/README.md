# Troubleshooting

> A Summary Of Tips That May Help When ESPHome Devices Don't Work As Expected

There are many moving parts in the *ESPHome experience*. When everything works as expected, this platform is amazing. When things don't work, the many interacting parts make it sometimes difficult to troubleshoot.



## Troubleshooting Offline Devices
Should your *ESPHome device* not show *ONLINE* in *ESPHome dashboard*, review the following troubleshooting steps:

* **Reset:** Press the *RESET* button on the microcontroller just to make sure the microcontroller is not locked in the *firmware upload mode*.   
* **Power:** Make sure you connect the microcontroller to a *solid and reliable* power source. Most cheap *USB splitters* do not provide enough power. Keep in mind that sensors and components may cause spikes of high power consumption. When the power supply is insufficient, the *ESPHome* firmware senses a *brown-out* and keeps resetting the microcontroller.   
* **Network:** Is the computer that is running *Home Assistant* connected *to the same network* as the microcontroller? This is crucial. If your *Home Assistant* is running on a *Raspberry Pi* that is using a *wired* network cable, and your microcontroller is connecting to *WiFi*, then *mDNS* may not work. 


<details><summary>Using Static IP Addresses (Not Recommended)</summary><br/>

While you *can* configure the *ESPHome* device to use *static IP addresses*, and while you also *can* use *ping* instead of *mDNS* to check for availability, these options are all just *workarounds* for a more fundamental underlying networking problem. 

If you apply these workarounds, chances are you eventually run into other issues until you *fix the underlying network problems* which almost always boil down to this: *Home Assistant* and your devices are connected to different subnets (i.e. *Raspberry Pi* running *Home Assistant* is connected to a *wired* network while all of your devices connect *wirelessly*, and your *WiFi* is running in *Router* mode, effectively separating these networks from each other in a way that *mDNS* name resolution does not work across the networks).    

If you cannot fix the network, you may work around it by using *static IP addresses* and/or *ping* instead of *mDNS*. 

To assign a static *IP address*, add these lines to the section *wifi:*:
````
  manual_ip:
    static_ip: 192.168.2.231
    gateway: 192.168.2.1
    subnet: 255.255.255.0
````

If the problem persists, you may want to disable the *WiFi power saving features* by adding this setting:

````
  power_save_mode: none
````

If you'd like to use *ping* instead of *mDNS* to check availability, in *Home Assistant* go to *Settings*, then *Add-ons*, then click on *ESPHome*. At the top of the page, click on *Configuration*, and turn on *Show unused optional configuration options*. Identify the option *Use ping for status* and turn it on. Then click on *SAVE*. 

**IMPORTANT:** click on the *SAVE* right next to the group of settings you changed. You are prompted to restart *ESPHome*.
