# Example Devices

> Practical Examples Illustrating How To Edit ESPHome Configurations 

When you initially provision an *ESPHome* device, it can't do anything special. *ESPHome* just enables it to report its *online status*, and to *upload new firmware*.

Anything else you want the device to *do* or be *capable of* needs to be added to its *configuration*.

## Learning By Doing
In the [previous article](https://done.land/tools/software/esphome/introduction/editconfiguration) you learned how you open, edit, and save a *ESPHome configuration*, and how you automatically derive *firmware* from it and upload it wirelessly to your *ESPHome device*.

Now it is time to look at some example devices to better understand just *how you edit configurations* and *what your options are*.

I am adding new examples as I go, so below list is a *work in progress*:


* [Push Button:](https://done.land/tools/software/esphome/introduction/exampledevices/pushbutton) Use a simple push button that can then be tied to any other device. In essence, the *push button* serves as an example on how to build physical dashboards that can control any other device   
* [CO2 Sensor:](https://done.land/tools/software/esphome/introduction/exampledevices/co2sensor) Use a *SCD30* CO2 sensor component to precisely measure the *CO2 concentration* in the air.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you edit a *configuration*, always make sure you click *SAVE* in the upper right corner when you are done. Closing the editor without saving immediately discards all changes without confirmation.
