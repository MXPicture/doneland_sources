# Home Assistant

> Free & Open-Source Automation Software Providing Dashboards That Can Manage All Of Your Device

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is an open-source platform designed for *home automation*, allowing users to control and manage various smart devices from a *single browser-based user interface*.

## Key Features

Key features of *Home Assistant* are:

* **Privacy/No Cloud:** *Home Assistant* runs in your own network and does not depend on external *Cloud Services*.
* **Open Source/Free:** It is free *open-source software* with no strings or recurring cost attached to it.
* **Compatibility:** The software offers support for various *IoT platforms* so you can integrate a wide range of commercial devices and sensors as well as your own *DIY microcontroller projects*.

> [!TIP]
> Even though *Home Assistant* does not depend on any cloud services and runs entirely in the privacy of your home network, you *can* integrate *cloud-based* devices such as *Blink cameras* or *Tuya smart devices*. You also can set up a [remote access](https://done.land/tools/software/homeassistant/internetaccess) to access your *Home Assistant user interface* from anywhere in the world. 


*Home Assistant* is *Python*-based and runs on any operating system that supports *Python*. One very popular option is to set up a cheap *Raspberry Pi computer* and run *Home Assistant* on it. 

### Universal Dashboard
Its unparalleled *extensibility* makes *Home Assistant* highly interesting not just for anyone interested in *automating their homes* and *making sure everything is alright at home*, but also for *electronics hobbyists* with no relation to *home automation* at all: 

Simplifying DIY Microcontroller Projects

Microcontroller-based DIY projects can be *simplified* significantly with *Home Assistant*: it provides necessary *graphical interfaces* and helps you *manage* and *leverage the capabilities* of your self-made devices:

* **Dashboards:** easy-to-create *dashboards*  provide graphical user interfaces to display device (sensor) data, and *UI control elements* such as *buttons* or *color wheels* to manage their functionality.
* **Automations:** powerful automation scripts can respond to *device state changes* and invoke *actions* - across all devices from all vendors managed by *Home Assistant* (including self-made hardware).
* **Notifications:** Automation rules can issue notifications to a variety of devices or even send *emails* when certain conditions are met.

### User Interface
*Home Assistant* uses a *browser-based user interface* that can be opened in any browser on any device (including smartphones), and the official *Home Assistant App* available for *Android* and *iPhone* further simplifies access.
The *app* even allows to optionally send back *smartphone sensor data* (such as position) to *Home Assistant* so that devices can be *turned on or off* based on whether you are at home or not.

### Privacy And Remote Access
In stark contrast to most *commercial* home automation solutions, *Home Assistant* prioritizes privacy and local control, ensuring that all data and operations remain within the user's home network. 

There *is* an **optional** *Home Assistant Cloud* service that can be used for secure *remote control* from anywhere of the world. You can as well set up such a remote control for free yourself, or deliberately do without any remote access for *privacy reasons*.

## Supported Platforms
*Home Assistant* is written in *Python*, which makes it compatible with many platforms that support *Python*. However, there are a [few important nuances](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) to consider:

* You get the richest experience with the full feature set when *Home Assistant* runs on the *Home Assistant OS*, i.e. when using a *Raspberry Pi* computer with the *Home Assistant* image.

* When *Home Assistant* runs in *docker* or *virtualized machines*, some features like *Add-ons* may not be available. The official [documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) lists all installation variations and the features that can be used.


> [!NOTE]
> If you don't know what *docker* is, then don't worry. [Setting up](https://done.land/components/microcontroller/families/raspberry/raspberrypi/assembly/setup) *Home Assistant* in *default configuration* on a cheap *Raspberry Pi* is simple, does not require any special technical knowhow, and takes just a few minutes.


### Raspberry Pi 5
One of the best and easiest-to-setup platforms to *host Home Assistant* is a *Raspberry Pi 5*: it is cheap, very powerful, fully supported, and has an excellent low energy consumption.


A [fully illustrated guide](https://done.land/components/microcontroller/families/raspberry/raspberrypi/assembly/parts) walks you through all required steps and covers the required parts, the *Raspberry Setup*, and *installing Home Assistant*.

## Important Prerequisites
*Home Assistant* works best with a stable *WiFi* and good coverage everywhere in your home.

For *Home Assistant* to reliably work, it is of *utmost importance* that both the computer running *Home Assistant* **and** *all of your devices* are connected to **the same network**. 

Make sure you are not [inadvertedly run *different subnets*](https://done.land/fundamentals/network/wifi).
