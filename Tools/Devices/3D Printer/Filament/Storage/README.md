# Filament Storage

> Improve Print Quality by Storing 3D Printer Filament Correctly

Most filament spools come in airtight bags to protect them from moisture. When you open such packaging—or if the filament wasn’t delivered in a sealed, airtight bag in the first place—follow these simple guidelines to prevent your filament from degrading.

<img src="images/filament_original_pack_t.png" width="40%" height="40%" />

## Overview

Most filament materials are, to some degree, *hygroscopic*—they absorb moisture from the surrounding air over time. Wet filament can lead to degraded print quality, including stringing, bubbling, or weak layers which is why you should make sure your filament is kept in low humidity.

There are varying approaches to managing filament storage:

1. **Filament Dryers**: Actively remove moisture from filament.  
2. **Airtight Containers**: Store filament with silica gel for passive drying.  
3. **Unprotected Storage**: Leaving filament exposed to room air—often leading to issues.

The impact of moisture depends on:  
- **Relative Humidity (RH)** in the environment.  
- **Filament Material** and its susceptibility to moisture.

Highly hygroscopic materials (e.g., *PVA*, *Nylon*) require strict moisture control, whereas others (e.g., *PLA*) are more forgiving but still benefit from proper storage.

## Storage Recommendations

### General Guidelines

1. **Use Airtight Containers**: Store spools in plastic containers with airtight seals.
2. **Include Desiccants**: Add silica gel packs to absorb residual moisture.  
3. **Monitor Humidity**: Use a small digital hygrometer to ensure RH stays below 30%.  
4. **Avoid Problem Areas**: Don’t store filament near windows, heaters, or damp areas (e.g., basements).  

### Passive Drying

Passive drying prevents moisture absorption using desiccants, like silica gel, without applying heat.

- **Use Color-Changing Silica Gel**: Monitors saturation levels (e.g., orange → green or blue → pink).  
- **Silica Gel Requirements**: 20–30g per spool for optimal effectiveness.  
- **Regeneration**: Heat silica gel in an oven at 100–120°C for 2–3 hours.  

**Ideal Conditions**: Maintain relative humidity (RH) below 30% and temperature between 15–25°C.

Quality sellers ship their spools in airtight plastic bags and include small silica gel packs. **Do not throw these away.** They are designed to attach to your print spools and help keep humidity levels low, particularly when you store the spools in an enclosed container:

<img src="images/silica_bag_small_t.png" width="30%" height="30%" />

### Bulk Silica Gel

You can also purchase silica gel in bulk for larger-scale humidity control:

<img src="images/silica_bag_t.png" width="50%" height="50%" />


Silica gel is often **color-coded** to indicate its moisture level. It starts **orange** when dry and turns **greenish/blueish** once saturated. Here is a picture of some silica gel that was used for a month in a *Bambu Lab AMS*:

<img src="images/silica_regenerate_before_t.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

> [!TIP]     
> The time it takes for silica gel to become saturated depends on where you use it: in a well-sealed filament container, it can last many months. In a less sealed environment (like the *Bambu Lab AMS*), you may have to replace or regenerate it after a few weeks. Coincidentally, the more often you need to replace it, the more important it is that you use silica gel in the first place, as this is an indicator of how much moisture the gel absorbed (which would have otherwise damaged your filament).     

### Regenerating Silica Gel
Do not throw saturated (greenish/blueish) silica gel away—it can be easily regenerated:

1. Place the silica gel on a plate, spread it out in a thin layer, and place it into an oven.

     <img src="images/silica_regenerate_oven5_t.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

2. Set the oven temperature to *110-150°C* (*230-300°F*), and use hot air (do not use grills or barbecue mode).

     <img src="images/silica_regenerate_after.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

3. Leave it in the oven for approximately an hour. If you use color-coded silica gel, regeneration is complete when the silica turns orange again.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that the silica gel is placed in a heat-safe dish and kept away from direct contact with heating elements. Ventilate the area if any odor is noticed during regeneration. Always monitor the process to prevent overheating or damage to the silica gel.


#### Caveats
Regenerating silica gel is straightforward with a reliable oven, but it is crucial to control the temperature accurately and ensure even heat distribution to prevent any fire hazard.

Household ovens may struggle to maintain low, precise temperatures since they are primarily designed for much higher cooking temperatures. If you are unsure about your oven's accuracy, start with a lower temperature and measure it with a reliable thermometer.

Always use an appropriate heating mode, such as hot air. Avoid modes that generate intense heat, like barbecue or grilling modes, as they can overheat the silica gel and pose risks.

Microwave ovens can also be used but are much harder to control due to the way they generate and apply heat. Typically, microwaves create hot spots, which can result in uneven heating. If you must use a microwave:

1. Set it to a low energy setting.  
2. Heat the silica gel in short intervals.  
3. Stir the gel frequently to distribute the heat evenly.  

> [!WARNING]
> Never leave silica gel unattended during regeneration, especially when using a microwave. Uneven heating or excessive temperatures can lead to overheating, damage to the gel, or even a fire hazard.


### DIY Silica Containers

Many electronic components, such as displays and boards, come in small plastic containers that can be repurposed as **silica gel holders**. To make one:

1. Ensure the container is large enough to hold **20g to 50g** of silica gel.
2. Drill a large number of **ventilation holes** into the container. The holes should be smaller than the silica gel pieces to prevent spillage.

<img src="images/silica_case_selfmade_t.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

> [!TIP]
> If you decide to place silica gel in an extra container, it is crucial to drill enough holes so that there is sufficient ventilation. The container in the picture managed to drop humidity in a plastic container at a rate of 5%/day, and even after 3 days, humidity in the container was still above 30% (so more holes are required). Pouring silica gel directly into the plastic container dropped humidity to around 10% in hours.

These DIY containers can be placed into the **AMS (Automatic Material System)** of your printer or any storage solution you use. 


#### Plastic Boxes

Alternatively, consider **plastic filament storage boxes**. Generic plastic cereal boxes work well too:

<img src="images/filament_store_placement_top_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />

> [!TIP]
> With plastic boxes, you may want to fill silica gel right into it so it covers the ground, without bothering to place it into separate boxes. This works excellently, and due to the large surface area, humidity quickly drops to around 10%. Once the gel is eventually saturated (which is when it changes color and turns blueish), you can easily pour the silica into a container to regenerate it in an oven. 

### Monitoring Storage Conditions

To monitor humidity effectively, add a **cheap electronic hygrometer** to your storage box. This allows you to keep an eye on the humidity level and ensure optimal conditions for your filament.

> [!TIP]
> Most cheap electronic humidity meters require one or two *LR44* button cells. They are not always included.

For added convenience, you can install a **ball-bearing filament support** and create a small hole with a tube in the box's cover. This setup allows you to feed filament directly to the printer while keeping the spools in low-humidity storage conditions:

<img src="images/filament_store_hygrometer_t.png" width="80%" height="80%" />

## Active Drying

If filament has absorbed moisture, **active drying** uses **heat** to remove it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once filament has absorbed significant moisture, you can no longer rely on **passive drying** with silica gel. At normal room temperatures, the diffusion process is not strong enough to effectively remove the moisture trapped in the filament. You now need to *add heat* to remove the moisture.



You can dry filament in any controlled hot environment as long as the air temperature stays below the filament's **glass transition temperature (Tg)** to prevent softening or deformation which would permanently damage your filament and render it unusable.

Common methods include:

- **Ovens**
- **Food dehydrators**
- even **Saunas** are sometimes used

However, these methods often have limitations. Most ovens and food dehydrators **lack precise temperature control**, which can lead to uneven or ineffective drying. Additionally, such setups can be inconvenient for regular use and often are highly energy inefficient.

### Dedicated Filament Dryers

To address these challenges, **dedicated filament dryers** are available. These devices come in various shapes and sizes and heat just as much room as is required to store the filament spool(s) you want to dry: some models can dry just **one spool** at a time, while others can handle **two or even four spools** simultaneously:

<img src="images/filament_dryer2_t.png" width="70%" height="70%" />

### Advantages of Filament Dryers

1. **Precision:** Filament dryers often include pre-programmed temperature settings for different filament types, eliminating the need to remember drying temperatures, and can maintain this temperature very precisely.
2. **Convenience:** Many models come with a built-in **timer**, allowing for automated drying cycles.
3. **Continuous Protection:** Most filament dryers allow you to **feed filament directly** from the dryer to the printer. This ensures the filament remains dry throughout the printing process.
4. **Improved Print Quality:** Printing with pre-heated filament can enhance print quality, particularly at **faster print speeds**: pre-heated filament reduces the print head's workload, minimizes friction in the tubes, and ensures smoother extrusion.


By combining proper storage, monitoring, and drying techniques, you can significantly extend the life of your filament and improve the quality of your 3D prints.

#### Drying Temperature Recommendations

| **Filament**   | **Drying Temp** | **Duration**      | **Softening Point (Tg)** |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **PLA**       | 40–45°C         | 4–6 hours         | ~60°C                   |
| **PETG**      | 60–65°C         | 4–6 hours         | ~80°C                   |
| **Nylon**     | 70–80°C         | 8–12 hours        | ~90–100°C               |
| **PVA**       | 55–60°C         | 6–8 hours         | ~60°C                   |
| **PVB**       | 60–70°C         | 6–8 hours         | ~70°C                   |
| **ABS/ASA**   | 70–80°C         | 4–6 hours         | ~90°C                   |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Lower temperatures work but take longer. For example, drying PLA at 30°C instead of 45°C will reduce moisture but take twice as long.



## Environmental Humidity Thresholds

If airtight containers are unavailable, keep filament in low-humidity environments. Below is a summary of RH limits for safe open storage:

| **Filament**   | **Max Safe RH (%)** | **Notes**                                                       |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PLA**       | 30–40               | Absorbs slowly; safe for months at low RH.                     |
| **PETG**      | 30–40               | Moisture causes stringing and reduced print quality.           |
| **TPU**       | 20–30               | Very sensitive; poor adhesion when exposed to moisture.        |
| **Nylon**     | 10–20               | Extremely hygroscopic; airtight storage is mandatory.          |
| **PVA**       | 10–20               | Requires sealed storage to avoid rapid degradation.            |
| **ABS/ASA**   | 30–40               | Resistant but benefits from dry environments.                  |
| **PC**        | 20–30               | Moisture causes bubbles and weak layers.                       |



## Summary

For best print quality:

1. **Store Filament Airtight**: Use containers with silica gel to maintain RH below 30%.  
2. **Dry Filament Actively**: If moisture absorption occurs, use a filament dryer at safe temperatures.  
3. **Monitor Your Environment**: Avoid high humidity or temperature fluctuations.
