# Filament Storage

> Improve Print Quality by Storing 3D Printer Filament Correctly

Most filament spools come in airtight bags to protect them from moisture. When you open such packaging—or if the filament wasn’t delivered in a sealed, airtight bag in the first place—follow these simple guidelines to prevent your filament from degrading.



## Overview

Most filament materials are, to some degree, *hygroscopic*—they absorb moisture from the surrounding air over time. Wet filament can lead to degraded print quality, including stringing, bubbling, or weak layers.

There are varying approaches to managing filament storage:

1. **Filament Dryers**: Actively remove moisture from filament.  
2. **Airtight Containers**: Store filament with silica gel for passive drying.  
3. **Unprotected Storage**: Leaving filament exposed to room air—often leading to issues.

The impact of moisture depends on:  
- **Relative Humidity (RH)** in the environment.  
- **Filament Material** and its susceptibility to moisture.

Highly hygroscopic materials (e.g., *PVA*, *Nylon*) require strict moisture control, whereas others (e.g., *PLA*) are more forgiving but still benefit from proper storage.

> *Hygroscopy* refers to a material's affinity to water. The *Speed of Absorption* indicates how quickly a material absorbs moisture—*Very Fast* means significant absorption occurs within hours.



## Storage Recommendations

### General Guidelines

1. **Use Airtight Containers**: Store spools in plastic containers with airtight seals.
2. **Include Desiccants**: Add silica gel packs to absorb residual moisture.  
3. **Monitor Humidity**: Use a small digital hygrometer to ensure RH stays below 30%.  
4. **Avoid Problem Areas**: Don’t store filament near windows, heaters, or damp areas (e.g., basements).  

### Passive Drying

Passive drying prevents moisture absorption using desiccants, like silica gel, without applying heat.

- **Use Color-Changing Silica Gel**: Monitors saturation levels (e.g., orange → green or blue → pink).  
- **Silica Gel Requirements**: 20–30g per spool for optimal effectiveness.  
- **Regeneration**: Heat silica gel in an oven at 100–120°C for 2–3 hours.  

**Ideal Conditions**: Maintain relative humidity (RH) below 30% and temperature between 15–25°C.



### Active Drying

When filament has absorbed moisture, *active drying* uses heat to remove it. Ensure the drying temperature stays below the filament’s glass transition temperature (Tg) to prevent softening or deformation.

#### Drying Temperature Recommendations

| **Filament**   | **Drying Temp** | **Duration**      | **Softening Point (Tg)** |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **PLA**       | 40–45°C         | 4–6 hours         | ~60°C                   |
| **PETG**      | 60–65°C         | 4–6 hours         | ~80°C                   |
| **Nylon**     | 70–80°C         | 8–12 hours        | ~90–100°C               |
| **PVA**       | 55–60°C         | 6–8 hours         | ~60°C                   |
| **PVB**       | 60–70°C         | 6–8 hours         | ~70°C                   |
| **ABS/ASA**   | 70–80°C         | 4–6 hours         | ~90°C                   |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Lower temperatures work but take longer. For example, drying PLA at 30°C instead of 45°C will reduce moisture but take twice as long.



## Environmental Humidity Thresholds

If airtight containers are unavailable, keep filament in low-humidity environments. Below is a summary of RH limits for safe open storage:

| **Filament**   | **Max Safe RH (%)** | **Notes**                                                       |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PLA**       | 30–40               | Absorbs slowly; safe for months at low RH.                     |
| **PETG**      | 30–40               | Moisture causes stringing and reduced print quality.           |
| **TPU**       | 20–30               | Very sensitive; poor adhesion when exposed to moisture.        |
| **Nylon**     | 10–20               | Extremely hygroscopic; airtight storage is mandatory.          |
| **PVA**       | 10–20               | Requires sealed storage to avoid rapid degradation.            |
| **ABS/ASA**   | 30–40               | Resistant but benefits from dry environments.                  |
| **PC**        | 20–30               | Moisture causes bubbles and weak layers.                       |



## Summary

For best print quality:

1. **Store Filament Airtight**: Use containers with silica gel to maintain RH below 30%.  
2. **Dry Filament Actively**: If moisture absorption occurs, use a filament dryer at safe temperatures.  
3. **Monitor Your Environment**: Avoid high humidity or temperature fluctuations.  

> [!TIP]
> Vacuum-sealing and using hygrometers further ensure your filament stays moisture-free.
