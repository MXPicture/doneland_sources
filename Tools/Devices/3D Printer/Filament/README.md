# Filament for 3D Printing

> Thermoplastic Material Used As Raw Input For 3D Printers

The most popular and simplest-to-use 3D Printers use *FDM* technology: *Fused Deposition Modeling*. In FDM, a spool feeds thermoplastic **filament** through an extruder that heats, melts, and extrudes the plastic through a thin nozzle. So for a FDM 3D printer, *filament* is equivalent to *toner* in laser printers.

## Overview

Filament is typically sold in spools of *1kg* and with a filament diameter of *1.75mm*. It is available in many different colors, can be shiny, transparent, or matte.

What's more important is the actual filament *material*: the most popular being *PLA* (polylactic acid) because it is affordable, requires relatively low temperatures to melt, and even beginners can produce great-looking results without the need of tweaking and optimizing settings. 

*PETG* (polyethylene terephthalate glycol, the same material that is used in one-way plastic bottles) is another very popular filament type which requires only slightly higher temperatures. It is even more affordable and has a better UV resistance (important for prints that are intended to be used out-doors). On the downside, *PETG* prints do not look as good as *PLA* prints: they are typically very shiny and often layer lines are clearly visible.


## Filament Materials

*PLA* and *PETG* are just two out of a great number of filament materials that can be used in FDM 3D printing. 

Here is a quick orientation:
