# Batteries

> Batteries Provide Portable Power. Rechargeable Batteries Store Immense Energy And Can Be Refilled Thousands Of Times 

A battery cell contains *chemistry* able to *store electrons*. Regular batteries use *chemistries* that cannot be *recharged*. *Rechargeable batteries* can be re-charged thousands of times.

## Chemistry Types

Batteries behave differently based on the *chemistry* they use internally:

* **Lead-Acid:** these are the typical classic *car batteries*: they are *heavy* (lead), use *acid*, *discharge* when not used and need service.
* **NiCad:** *Nickel/Cadmium* was used in early rechargeable batteries. Their ingredients are *toxic*, and the particular *chemistry* is sensitive towards the *memory effect*: batteries have to always be completely *discharged* before they need to be *fully charged*. Else, their total capacity may suffer.
* **Lithium Coin:** these ubiquous small **3V** batteries are used in numerous small devices. They cannot be recharged. Common types are *CR2025*, *CR2032*, etc. Their chemistry is *LiMnO2*.
* **Lithium Primary:** these **3V** batteries (i.e. *CR123A*) can use *LiMnO2* or *LiFeS2* chemistry and are also not rechargeable.
* **LiIon:** *Lithium-Ion* batteries were the first *modern* types of *rechargeable* batteries: they have *no memory effect*. They use *cobalt* or *manganese cathodes* which provide a *very high energy density*. Because of their high *energy density*, they can *catch fire or explode* when physically damaged, *short circuited* or *over-charged* which is why they should always be used with a proper *BMS* (*battery management system*). They can also be damaged when they are *completely discharged*.
* **LiPo:** *Lithum-Polymer* behaves very similar to *LiIon* and use similar *chemistry*. Their *energy density* is even higher and they are *malleable*: they comes in *pouches* and many other form factors. They often can have *higher discharge rates* as well although this depends on particular type. This comes at a cost: *LiPo* has lower charging cycles than *LiIon* and a shorter lifespan. *LiPo* is also more prone to *swelling*, *overheating* and *catching fire* when not handled properly. In general, *LiPo* batteries tend to be more expensive than *LiIon* when otherwise sharing the same technical specs. Because of their technical similarity, *LiIon* and *LiPo* can share the same *chargers* and *BMS*.
* **LiFePo4/LFP:** *Lithium-Ferro-Phosphate* has less *energy density* than *LiIon* and *LiPo* but is much safer: cells typically neither *catch fire* nor *explode* when mistreated. The *chemistry* uses *iron* instead of expensive and rare materials such as *cobalt* and *manganese*. *LiFePo4* have the most *charging cycles* (life span is often >3000 cycles) without significant degradation. Their voltage stays *exceptionally stable* during discharge. Because of their lower *energy density*, they are bigger and heavier than *LiIon* and *LiPo*. *LiFePo4* uses *lower nominal voltages* than *LiIon* and *LiPo*: they need specific *chargers* and *BMS*.
