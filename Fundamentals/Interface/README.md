# Interfaces

> Interfaces Connect Digital Components And Make Data Exchange Possible

*Interfaces* represent a *contract* between *two parties* on how to interact with each other, i.e. how to *interpret* the signals sent. *Hardware interfaces* are a *hardware implementation* of such a contract. 

*Understanding interfaces* is important to know *how to speak* to a particular device and make sure *it understands commands correctly*.

## Connecting Components

When connecting *digital components* such as *sensors*, *displays* and alike, *interfaces* are used. The two most common interfaces for connecting components with microcontrollers are *I2C* and *SPI*.
