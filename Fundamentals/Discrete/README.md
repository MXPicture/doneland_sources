# Discrete Parts

> **Discrete devices are disparate components like resistors, diodes or transistors. I'll document them here as I encounter them in my projects.**

**Discrete** devices (parts, components, you name it) are electronic components that are *disparate*: you can't break them up in smaller units. They are the basic ingredients for anything more complex, like a *IC*, a *microprocessor*, or a complete *device*.

## Active and Passive

**Passive** *discrete* components always behave in the same way: *resistors*, *capacitors*, and *coils* are the most common representatives of this group.

**Active** *discrete* components in contrast can significantly change their behavior depending on their input signals. The most important *active* component obviously is the *transistor*, but *diodes* (and *LEDs*) are also member of this group. These components typically are based on *semiconductors* whereas *passive* components are not.

> [!NOTE]
> All of these definitions are somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes, even *ICs* (like *OpAmps*) and *voltage regulators* are called *discrete* and are added to the *active* components. Here, whenever I talk about *discrete* components I mean *really basic* electronic elements that can't be subdivided. *ICs* and even more so *voltage regulators* are complex circuits consisting of a whole bunch of transistors, capacitors, resistors, and coils. It beats me why something like this should ever be called *discrete*.
