# Fundamentals

> **Understanding Fundamental Electronic Parts Including Specs, Hints and Examples**

*Breakout boards* and *microcontrollers* are an efficient way of quickly plugging together working electronic devices. There's only very little need to understand the *fundamentals* of electronics.

## Why should I dig deeper?

There's no need for you to visit this section unless you're hungry for more.

In this section I look at the *discrete* parts of electronics like *transistors*, *resistors*, *capacitors* and *coils*. Understanding these building blocks of *breakout boards* and *ICs* can be awesome, and sometimes even necessary.

## Do More With Less

What if you just want to have a *latched push button* to power on and off your device? What if your button needs to switch a much bigger load than it could handle or would be safe to do?

That's what you can put together with a few *transistors* and *resistors*. Yes, there may be even *breakout boards* for *latched buttons* and *switching MosFETs*. Using discrete parts gives you more flexibility, cheaper cost and smaller form factors.

## Discrete Components

[Discrete](./Discrete) components are the most basic electronic parts that cannot be divided any further, like *transistors* or *resistors*.
